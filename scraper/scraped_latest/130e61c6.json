Building on that foundation, the CuRB curriculum was developed in response to a need for evolving our existing bystander intervention program to be more responsive to how power, bias, and privilege impact our ability to support others. After holding pilot sessions with students, staff and faculty throughout 2023, CuRB is now live and available to the CMU community for those interested in bystander intervention training."

      "text": "The CuRB training covers how identity, power, and privilege impacts our role as bystanders and provides space to explore how we arrive at our understandings and perceptions of others. This focus on group reflection and discussion sets the stage for collaboratively unlearning harmful biases that might negatively impact our ability to help loved ones or community members experiencing power-based personal violence. Through open discussion, scenario exercises and actionable tools, CuRB empowers participants to intercept different forms of harm and provide culturally responsive and person-centered support."
