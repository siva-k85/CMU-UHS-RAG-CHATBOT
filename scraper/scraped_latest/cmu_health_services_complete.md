### Services
- **In-Network providers (doctors) or facilities (laboratories, urgent care centers, hospitals, or imaging centers) participate in your insurance plan network. The most cost effective way to seek care is to see healthcare providers that are in-network. If you have the CMU SHIP and see an in-network provider, there is nodeductible.**
- **Out-of-Network providers do not participate in your insurance plan network. If you have the CMU medical SHIP and see an out-of-network provider, the plan will cover 80% of the cost of the service after you meet yourdeductible. The dental plan has differentcoinsurancerates.**
- **A PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) medical plan provides healthcare coverage through a network of providers, and you pay less if you use providers and hospitals within the plan's network. However, you can go outside of the network for an additional cost (seecoinsurance).**
- **An HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) plan provides healthcare coverage through a network of providers, but you are generally limited to seeing providers within the HMO network for covered services, with limited or no coverage for out-of-network care (except for emergencies). HMO networks are generally limited to the area where the person lived at the time of their enrollment.**

## Leaving CMU -     University Health Services -     Student Affairs - Carnegie Mellon University
*URL: https://www.cmu.edu/health-services/leaving-cmu/index.html*

Learn more about what to do when you leave Carnegie Mellon University in regards to requesting your medical records and other important steps


## Leaving CMU?

Before you embark on your next journey, make sure that you review this page thoroughly to learn more about access to services, your insurance plan and requesting your medical records.


### Graduating Students

If you graduate in May, you can be seen at Health Services for two weeks following your graduation date. If you graduate in December, you can be seen at Health Services up until our winter holiday closure.

If you are in Pittsburgh after that time and need services, we can help you findlocal providersfor your health care needs.


##### If you are enrolled in the CMU student health insurance plan:

You have that coverage until July 31. This is a national plan and can be used in any state at any facility that accepts the insurance plan.

If you have an offer for employer-sponsored medical insurance, you are not required to cancel the CMU student medical insurance plan. You have the option to tell your employer that you have medical insurance in effect through July 31. The employer can then help you enroll in their plan effective August 1 because you would then have a loss of coverage (which is considered a qualifying life event for enrollment into a medical insurance plan outside of that plan's Open Enrollment period).

We strongly recommend comparing the student insurance plan with the one being offered by the employer. Pay close attention to not only the premiums, but deductible of the plans, co-pays, co-insurance, and the list of benefits offered.


## Request Your Medical Records

Immunization records, test results, statements and after-visit summaries are all available to download/print from HealthConnect. Current students and recent graduates (within 90 days) can request additional medical records by using "Messages" inHEALTHCONNECT.

Former students who no longer have access to HealthConnect must submit aConsent for Release of Medical Information Form (pdf).

Please note that UHS maintains patient records for 10 years; we are unable to provide records beyond 10 years.

Students who received care at Counseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) must contact CaPS directly to request mental health records, at 412-268-2922.

### What is sexual violence?

The term "sexual violence" is an all-encompassing, non-legal term that refers to crimes like sexual assault, rape, and sexual abuse. If someone forces or manipulates someone else into any kind of unwanted sexual activity without their consent, it is sexual violence. Reasons someone may not be able to consent include fear, age, illness, disability, and/or influence of alcohol or other drugs. Many definitions related to consent and sexual violence may be found onThe Office of Institutional Equity & Title IX’s webpage.

You choose what happens next. In very limited circumstances, the University may be required to take additional steps to protect the campus community. For example, the University may need to investigate if there are multiple reports of similar conduct against one individual. Additionally, if there is a crime reported to have occurred on or near campus that represents a possible threat to the community, University Police may need to send out a “timely warning” to the community; the warning will not include identifying information about the impacted party.

What’s the difference between a report and a formal complaint?

The Office accepts reports of prohibited conduct from anyone at any time. A report is information provided to the Office regarding one or more incidents of prohibited conduct. Whether the person making the report decides to pursue an investigation or other resolution, or to not take any further action, is ultimately up to their own discretion. A Formal Complaint is a signed, written or typed document, requesting that the University initiate a formal investigation into the alleged prohibited misconduct.

## LGBTQIA+ Health -     University Health Services -     Student Affairs - Carnegie Mellon University
*URL: https://www.cmu.edu/health-services/services-and-fees/lgbtqia+.html*

this page describes health services provided to LGBTQIA+ students at Carnegie Mellon University.


## Healthcare for LGBTQIA+ Students

LGBTQIA+ students can receive general medical care, as well as specialized care, at University Health Services. This video shares a wealth of information about the ways UHS supports trans students:


### General Medical Care

We encourage LGBTQIA+ students to receive routine care. Specifically, UHS recommends that students follow guidelines for routine screening of sex-specific organs, like pap smears/gynecological exams, breast exams, prostate exams, etc. If you are uncomfortable with these types of exams, we are happy to talk with you about how to make them easier.


### Specialized Care


#### Gender Affirming Care Navigation Appointments

UHS now offers Gender Affirming Care Navigation Appointments! Meet with a Health Promotion Specialist to receive gender identity-related support, such as: name change (legal and within CMU), mental health provider referrals, medical provider referrals, sexual health, HRT support, finding surgery providers, obtaining letters for surgeries, basic health insurance info/support, a listening ear, and more. Schedule your appointment through HealthConnect or by calling 412-268-2127 (select option 2).


#### Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)

Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis is a new HIV prevention treatment. Taking PrEP once daily significantly lowers the risk of HIV transmission. PrEP is covered by the SHIP, CMU's student health insurance plan. Those with outside insurance should check to find out if PrEP is covered and what costs might apply. Additionally,the federal governmentannouncedin July of 2021 that almost all health insurers must cover the HIV prevention pill, known as PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, with no cost sharing — including for the drug itself and, crucially, for clinic visits and lab tests.

Students can make appointments to start or continue PrEP by calling 412-268-2157 (select option 2).Learn more about PrEP.


#### Hormone Therapy

UHS provides hormone therapy  for transgender students using the informed consent model. Hormone therapy is covered by the SHIP, CMU's student health insurance plan. Students can make appointments to start or continue Hormone therapy by calling 412-268-2157 (select option 2).

Informed consent is an evidence-based model of providing care that is used in healthcare agencies serving and run primarily by LGBTQIA+ and trans and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) communities. This means that UHS does not require a student to get a letter from a mental health provider in support of hormones as long as they can provide informed consent for care. A student can provide informed consent if they have correct information about hormone therapy; are able to understand the information about hormone therapy that has been provided, including risks and benefits as well as reversible and irreversible effects; and/or are able to use this information to make a decision.

Informed consent is an evidence-based model of providing care that is used in healthcare agencies serving and run primarily by LGBTQIA+ and trans and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) communities. This means that UHS does not require a student to get a letter from a mental health provider in support of hormones as long as they can provide informed consent for care. A student can provide informed consent if they have correct information about hormone therapy; are able to understand the information about hormone therapy that has been provided, including risks and benefits as well as reversible and irreversible effects; and/or are able to use this information to make a decision.

The informed consent model is consistent with WPATH Standards of Care and reduces barriers to accessing medically necessary treatment. In this model, students are given accurate and comprehensive information about hormone therapy and will be supported in making the decision that is right for them. Please note that providing care in an informed consent model does not mean that hormones are available on demand. If a medical provider determines that a student has a medical or psychological condition that might preclude the initiation of hormones until further evaluation or treatment, the student be will referred to the appropriate medical and/or psychological resources for further evaluation.


#### Connection to LGBTQIA+ Substance Use Resources

There are many substance use resources in the Pittsburgh community.This Young People and LGBTQIA+ Friendly 12-Step Meetings listincludes information about local peer-to-peer meetings and treatment centers that center LGBTQIA+ folks. For more information about recovery and harm reduction at CMU, please visit theCMU Collegiate Recovery & Harm Reduction webpage.


## Name, gender and sex assigned at birth documentation

UHS can include chosen name*, gender identity and sex assigned at birth in medical records. If you have a chosen* name documented inStudent Information Online (SIO), UHS automatically receives this information. You canalsoupdate your pronouns, name and gender identity in HealthConnect, or ask us to make these updates during a visit to UHS.

*SIO and HealthConnect use the term "preferred name," whereas we know community members recognize that the names we give ourselves are not just "preferred," they're our chosen names.


## Trans Health Zine

Learn more about the Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB) trainings, which explore how identity, privilege and power impact how we support those around us experiencing power-based interpersonal violence. CuRB helps participants practice strategies, skills and tools to be an active bystander


## Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB) at CMU

CMU community members were introduced to the concept of bystander intervention to disrupt power-based personal violence (dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking) throughGreen Dottraining from 2018-2023. Building on that foundation, the CuRB curriculum was developed in response to a need for evolving our existing bystander intervention program to be more responsive to how power, bias, and privilege impact our ability to support others. After holding pilot sessions with students, staff and faculty throughout 2023, CuRB is now live and available to the CMU community for those interested in bystander intervention training.

The CuRB training covers how identity, power, and privilege impacts our role as bystanders and provides space to explore how we arrive at our understandings and perceptions of others. This focus on group reflection and discussion sets the stage for collaboratively unlearning harmful biases that might negatively impact our ability to help loved ones or community members experiencing power-based personal violence. Through open discussion, scenario exercises and actionable tools, CuRB empowers participants to intercept different forms of harm and provide culturally responsive and person-centered support.
