CuRB helps participants practice strategies, skills and tools to be an active bystander\n\nMain Content:\nCulturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB) at CMU\nCMU community members were introduced to the concept of bystander intervention to disrupt power-based personal violence (dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking) through\nGreen Dot\ntraining from 2018-2023. Building on that foundation, the CuRB curriculum was developed in response to a need for evolving our existing bystander intervention program to be more responsive to how power, bias, and privilege impact our ability to support others. After holding pilot sessions with students, staff and faculty throughout 2023, CuRB is now live and available to the CMU community for those interested in bystander intervention training.\nThe CuRB training covers how identity, power, and privilege impacts our role as bystanders and provides space to explore how we arrive at our understandings and perceptions of others. This focus on group reflection and discussion sets the stage for collaboratively unlearning harmful biases that might negatively impact our ability to help loved ones or community members experiencing power-based personal violence. Through open discussion, scenario exercises and actionable tools, CuRB empowers participants to intercept different forms of harm and provide culturally responsive and person-centered support.\n\nHours of Operation:\nCulturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB) at CMUCMU community members were introduced to the concept of bystander intervention to disrupt power-based personal violence (dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking) throughGreen Dottraining from 2018-2023.

This video shares a wealth of information about the ways UHS supports trans students:\nGeneral Medical Care\nWe encourage LGBTQIA+ students to receive routine care. Specifically, UHS recommends that students follow guidelines for routine screening of sex-specific organs, like pap smears/gynecological exams, breast exams, prostate exams, etc. If you are uncomfortable with these types of exams, we are happy to talk with you about how to make them easier.\nSpecialized Care\nGender Affirming Care Navigation Appointments\nUHS now offers Gender Affirming Care Navigation Appointments! Meet with a Health Promotion Specialist to receive gender identity-related support, such as: name change (legal and within CMU), mental health provider referrals, medical provider referrals, sexual health, HRT support, finding surgery providers, obtaining letters for surgeries, basic health insurance info/support, a listening ear, and more.

Taking PrEP once daily significantly lowers the risk of HIV transmission. PrEP is covered by the SHIP, CMU's student health insurance plan. Those with outside insurance should check to find out if PrEP is covered and what costs might apply. Additionally,\nthe federal government\nannounced\nin July of 2021 that almost all health insurers must cover the HIV prevention pill, known as PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, with no cost sharing — including for the drug itself and, crucially, for clinic visits and lab tests.\nStudents can make appointments to start or continue PrEP by calling 412-268-2157 (select option 2).\nLearn more about PrEP.\nHormone Therapy\nUHS provides hormone therapy  for transgender students using the informed consent model.

This means that UHS does not require a student to get a letter from a mental health provider in support of hormones as long as they can provide informed consent for care. A student can provide informed consent if they have correct information about hormone therapy; are able to understand the information about hormone therapy that has been provided, including risks and benefits as well as reversible and irreversible effects; and/or are able to use this information to make a decision.\nThe informed consent model is consistent with WPATH Standards of Care and reduces barriers to accessing medically necessary treatment. In this model, students are given accurate and comprehensive information about hormone therapy and will be supported in making the decision that is right for them. Please note that providing care in an informed consent model does not mean that hormones are available on demand. If a medical provider determines that a student has a medical or psychological condition that might preclude the initiation of hormones until further evaluation or treatment, the student be will referred to the appropriate medical and/or psychological resources for further evaluation.\nConnection to LGBTQIA+ Substance Use Resources\nThere are many substance use resources in the Pittsburgh community.\nThis Young People and LGBTQIA+ Friendly 12-Step Meetings list\nincludes information about local peer-to-peer meetings and treatment centers that center LGBTQIA+ folks.

Eating disorders happen to people of all ages — from young children to older adults.\nEating disorders can involve complex and challenging relationships with food, eating, medicines like diet pills or laxatives, excessive exercise, and body image.\nThese are serious and potentially life-threatening physical and mental health conditions. Genetics, social pressures, and personal experiences can all play a part in how you perceive food and eating. It’s important to know that with help, you can get back in control of your health.\nSymptoms of an eating disorder can negatively affect all aspects of your life — not just your physical health. They can also affect your relationships and your ability to perform at school or work and even socialize.\nPeople with eating disorders often have:\nExtreme / unusual eating patterns or dieting behaviors.\nObsessive thoughts about food, body shape, or weight.\nMental health issues, like depression or anxiety.\nAbout the UPMC Western Behavioral Health Center for Eating Disorders\nThe UPMC Western Behavioral Health Center for Eating Disorders (CED) is built on more than 50 years of research. It is one of the few eating disorder programs in the country connected to a major academic center. The center brings together experts from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Western Psychiatric Hospital, and UPMC Western Behavioral Health.\nWe help people from across gender spectrum and lifespan. We offer appropriate programs for adults (over the age of 18) and children (ages 8 to 18).\nAdults with eating disorders receive care through UPMC Western Psychiatric Hospital inpatient and outpatient services.\nPediatric eating disorder services for children and teens are provided through UPMC Western Psychiatric Hospital inpatient and outpatient services and UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.\nThe eating disorder experts at the CED can evaluate and treat your problem. They include doctors, psychologists, nurses, dietitians, therapists, and other mental and behavioral health professionals. Due to the potential medical complications of eating disorders, your team always includes medical support.\nPrograms for Adults\nYour treatment is customized for you. Your treatment team will determine which level of care is best for you at each stage of care. This can include inpatient treatment, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient program, and outpatient therapy. Group and family therapy sessions are also an important part of treatment.\nInpatient treatment\nIf you are severely underweight or require medical stabilization, the hospital is the only place to give you the help you need. The CED is one of only a few psychiatric inpatient programs in the country dedicated to eating disorders and the only\ninpatient program of its kind\nin western Pennsylvania.\nOur licensed psychiatric inpatient unit at UPMC Western serves patients 12 years old and up who need help because of:\nAnorexia\nnervosa.\nBulimia\nnervosa.\nBinge eating\ndisorder.\nOther eating disorders\n.\nPartial hospitalization program\nOur partial hospitalization program (PHP) is for individuals ages 14 and older, who don’t need to be in the hospital for treatment but still need serious support. One of the goals of the PHP is to help you establish nutritional stability. This program meets five days a week, from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. each day.\nOur PHP helps people who:\nNeed close monitoring and supervised meals.\nHave failed to benefit from less-intensive care.\nAre acutely ill but do not need to be in the hospital full-time.\nNeed continued care to help maintain the progress they made during inpatient hospitalization.\nDaily group programming includes opportunities to:\nEat breakfast and lunch together and have a snack in the afternoon with trained staff.\nReceive coaching from experts in eating disorders on things like putting meals together and making meals for weekends.\nGet care from a team of psychiatrists, therapists, nurse practitioners, and dietitians.\nEngage in group and individual therapy targeting a variety of eating disorder-related concerns, such as body image.\nMeet weekly with a registered dietitian to understand food choices and health.\nIntensive outpatient program for adults\nEven after you return to work or school, continuing structured therapy will be essential for your recovery .  Our intensive outpatient program (IOP) requires a nine-hour per week commitment. You’ll meet Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays between 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.\nOur IOP offers adults:\nCare from a team of psychiatrists, therapists, dietitians, and family medicine experts specialized in eating disorders.\nGroup and one-on-one therapy.\nSupervised meals.\nOutpatient clinic for adults\nThe outpatient clinic serves adults who need help with eating disorders but not at a level that requires treatment daily or multiple times each week.\nDuring one of your initial appointments, you’ll talk with a clinical psychiatrist who will assess your condition and determine whether you would benefit from medicines.\nIn our outpatient clinic, you will:\nTake part in one-on-one therapy.\nParticipate in family therapy, if applicable.\nCED services are located at:\nBellefield Towers\n100 N Bellefield Ave.\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\nTo schedule an initial evaluation at CED, please complete the online form at\nUPMC.com/wphcedreferral\n.\nFor general questions about our CED services, please call\n412-246-6390\n.\nPrograms for Children and Adolescents\nIf your child needs medical care for an eating disorder,\nUPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh\nhas a brief medical stabilization and refeeding program.

Our team of mental and behavioral health professionals provides evaluation and treatment services for children ages 8 to 18.\nSKYE family-based therapy\nSKYE family-based therapy (FBT) serves children between the ages of 8 to 18. It is based on the successful evidence-based outcomes of the Maudsley method, which began in England more than 40 years ago.
