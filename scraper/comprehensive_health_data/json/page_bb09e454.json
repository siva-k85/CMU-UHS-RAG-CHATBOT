I\nt is also important to consider the following:\nWaiver Requirements\nAll medical insurance plans must meet\nuniversity waiver requirements\n. It is important to carefully review these requirements against your current plan, as most insurance plans from outside the U.S. will not meet our waiver requirements. Travel insurance plans do not meet university waiver requirements. Most travel plans only provide medical coverage for emergencies and do not provide coverage for routine exams (such as a check-up), pre-existing conditions, or mental health.\nThe only exception to this rule is for domestic students\nstudying abroad\nduring the the Fall term.\nIf you are unsure whether your plan meets CMU requirements, you can request a plan review through the\nStudent Health Insurance Office\n. Be sure to make the request prior to purchasing the plan.\nWaiver Coverage Periods\nAll insurance plans\nmust\nbe effective the first of the month you arrive on campus, and remain active for the duration of your time as an enrolled student. Please do not wait until you arrive in the U.S. to secure your insurance plan, or the effective date could be too late, and your waiver will be denied. Start looking into plans as soon as possible to ensure the plan will start when needed:\nFall students - if arriving in August, you must have insurance effective 8/1.\nSpring students - if arriving in January, you must have insurance effective 1/1.\nSummer students - if arriving in May, you must have insurance effective 5/1.\nIf you arrive either before or after these dates, contact the\nCMU Student Health Insurance Office\nfor assistance.\nCMU SHIP Enrollments\nInternational students\nmust have a U.S. address to enroll in the SHIP. This address is where you will receive your insurance member ID card and other insurance documents, so it is important that you can receive mail there\n.\nIf you do not have a U.S. address prior to your arrival, please wait until you have arrived to enroll\n:\nThe SHIP is effective starting August 1 (for students enrolled for the fall term) and January 1 (for students enrolled in the spring term).\nStudents not yet enrolled by August 1 will still be covered for any medical services after August 1.\nIf you need medical treatment prior to your enrollment, you can either request to be billed or pay for the service and submit a claim for reimbursement.\nFor any questions about SHIP enrollments and reimbursements, please contact the\nStudent Health Insurance\nOffice.\nDivision of Student Affairs\nAthletics, Physical Education & Recreation\nCareer & Professional Development Center\nCenter for Student Diversity & Inclusion\nCivility Initiatives\nCohon University Center\nCommunity Health & Well-Being\nCommunity Responsibility\nConference & Event Services\nCounseling & Psychological Services\nDean of Students\nDining Services\nFamily Engagement\nFirst-Year Orientation\nFraternity & Sorority Life\nHousing Services\nPre-College Programs\nResidential Education\nStudent Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\nStudent Support Resources\nUniversity Health Services\nWellness & Meaning-Making Programs\nUHS Partners\nAccreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\nDisability Resources\nTitle IX Initiatives\nUniversity Police\nUniversity Policies\nUniversity Health Services\nStudent Affairs\n100 Tech Street, 3rd Floor\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n412-268-2157\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n©\n2025\nCarnegie Mellon University\nCMU on Facebook\nCMU on Instagram\nHealthConnect\nNew Students\nFamily & Parents\nStudent Insurance\nEnroll in the SHIP\nWaive the SHIP\nChange or Cancel the SHIP\nSHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\nSHIP Rates & Billing\nUsing the SHIP\nInternational, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\nInsurance Literacy\nContacts & Common Questions\nLeaving CMU\nServices & Fees\nCOVID19\nSexual Assault Resources\nLGBTQIA+ Health\nSexual Health\nAllergy Injections\nHealth Education & Resources\nCulturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\nLocal Healthcare Resources\nPeer Health Advocates\nInformation for PHAs\nRecovery and Harm Reduction\nWellness To Go Machines\nAbout Us\nUHS News\nWho We Are\nLeaving CMU",
