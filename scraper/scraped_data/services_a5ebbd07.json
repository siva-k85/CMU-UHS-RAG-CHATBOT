  "content": "April 09, 2025\nMeasles cases on the rise\nMeasles cases have been popping up in many parts of the country, including Pennsylvania. According to the\nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention\n, measles is a highly contagious disease that can cause serious health complications. University Health Services (UHS) strongly recommends that all students are vaccinated.\nThe vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) is highly effective and much safer than the diseases it protects against. Being vaccinated not only protects you but helps to increase protection for our entire community. Check your immunization record in\nHealthConnect\nto see if you have already received the MMR vaccine. If not, you can schedule a vaccination appointment at UHS via\nHealthConnect\nor go to a local pharmacy.",
