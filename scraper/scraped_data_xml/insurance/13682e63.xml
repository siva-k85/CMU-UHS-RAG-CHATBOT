*PTOCLVL1*How Your Benefits Are Applied*TOCLVL1* ayment For Network Covered Expenses
*PTOCLVL2*Payment For Network Covered Expenses*TOCLVL2* rofessional Services
Eye Examination and Refractive Services
When a network provider is used, payment for eye examinations and refractive services is based on the plan
allowance.
Payment for the eye examination is made directly to the provider and is accepted as payment in full. If the eye
examination is subject to a copayment, as indicated in the Covered services, you are responsible for paying
that copayment amount to the provider.
Low Vision Care Services
When a network provider is used, payment for low vision care services is based on the amount of the
provider's charge up to the program allowance.
Payment for low vision care services is also made directly to the provider. However, you are responsible for the
difference between the program allowance and the provider's charge.
Laser Vision Correction Services
When a network provider is used, benefits for laser vision correction services are made available in the form of
a percentage discount of the provider's charge. You are responsible for paying the entire discounted price to
the provider.
Post-Refractive Products
When a network provider is used, payment for post-refractive products is based on the plan allowance, the
amount of the provider's charge up to the program allowance or the discounted price which the provider has
agreed to accept in satisfaction of its charge.
Payment of the plan allowance is made directly to the provider and is accepted as payment-in-full. If the
covered post-refractive product is subject to a copayment, as indicated in the Covered Services, you are
responsible for paying that copayment amount to the provider.
If payment for the covered post-refractive product is made up to the program allowance, as indicated in the
Schedule of Benefits, you are responsible for any difference between that amount and the provider's charge.
For those post-refractive products that are provided in the form of a discounted price, as indicated in the
Covered services, you are responsible for paying the entire discounted price to the network provider.
Payment For Out-of-Network Covered Expenses
*WTOCLVL2*Payment For Out-of-Network Covered Expenses*TOCLVL2* hen an out-of-network provider is used, payment for covered expenses is based on the amount of the
provider's charge up to the program allowance, as indicated in the Covered services. You are responsible for
the difference between the program allowance and the provider's charge.
You may &quot;split&quot; your benefits by receiving your eye examination and eyeglasses (or contact lenses) on
different dates or through different provider locations, if desired. However, complete eyeglasses must be
obtained at one time and from one provider. Continuity of care will best be maintained when all available
services are obtained at one time from either a network or out-of-network provider.

lenses are intended to offer you better eye health, clearer vision, increased comfort and a &quot;fresh
lens feeling&quot; on a continuous basis. There is very little to no maintenance involved with these
lenses.
l Medically necessary contact lenses - A contact lens considered eligible only after cataract surgery,
corneal transplant surgery or other conditions such as, but not limited to, keratoconus or when
adequate visual acuity is not attainable with eyeglasses but can be achieved through the use of
contact lenses. Medically necessary contact lenses are a contact lens that a provider, exercising
prudent clinical judgment, would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, evaluating,
diagnosing or treating an illness, injury, disease or its symptoms, and that are:
¡ in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice;
¡ clinically appropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, site and duration, and considered
effective for the patient's illness, injury or disease; and
¡ not primarily for the convenience of the patient, physician, or other health care provider, and
not more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services at least as likely to
produce equivalent therapeutic or diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or treatment of that
patient's illness, injury or disease.
11

Highmark reserves the right, utilizing the criteria set forth in this description, to render the final
determination as to whether covered contact lenses are medically necessary. This benefit will not be
provided unless Highmark determines that the covered contact lenses are medically necessary.
Medically necessary contact lenses are subject to preauthorization. If the required preauthorization is not
obtained, no benefits will be paid for such lenses and the entire charge will be your responsibility.

from the group.
17

responsibility of the group to notify you of the termination of coverage. However, coverage will be
terminated regardless of whether the notice is given to you by the group.
l If it is proven that you obtained or attempted to obtain benefits or payment for benefits through fraud
or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact, Highmark may, upon notice to you, terminate
your coverage under the program.
l It is understood that you have an affirmative obligation to notify the group or Highmark as soon as
the domestic partnership has been terminated. Upon termination of the domestic partnership,
coverage of the former domestic partner and the children of the former domestic partner will

NOTICE OF CLAIM AND PROOF OF LOSS
Network Providers have directly or indirectly entered into an agreement with the Plan pertaining to the payment
for Covered Services rendered to a Member. When a Member receives Covered Services from a Network
Provider, it is the responsibility of the Network Provider to submit its claim to the Plan in accordance with the
terms of its participation agreement. Should the Network Provider fail to submit its claim in a timely manner or
otherwise satisfy the Plan’s requirements as they relate to the filing of claims, the Member will not be liable and
the Network Provider shall hold the Member harmless relative to payment of the Covered Services received by
the Member.
When Covered Services are received from other than a Network Provider, the Member is responsible for
submitting the claim to the Plan. In such instances, the Member must submit the claim in accordance with the
following procedures:
1. Notice of Claim
The Plan will not be liable for any claims under this Contract unless proper notice is furnished to the Plan that
Covered Services in this Contract have been rendered to a Member. Written notice of a claim must be given to
the Plan within twenty (20) days or as soon as reasonably possible after Covered Services have been
rendered to the Member. Notice given by or on behalf of the Member to the Plan that includes information
sufficient to identify the Member that received the Covered Services shall constitute sufficient notice of a claim
to the Plan. The Member can give notice to the Plan by writing to the Member Services Department. The

received, furnish to the Member claim forms for filing proofs of loss. If claim forms are not furnished within
fifteen (15) days after the giving of such notice, the Member shall be deemed to have complied with the

provided to the Plan within ninety (90) days after the date of such loss. Proof of loss must include all data
necessary for the Plan to determine benefits. Failure to submit a proof of loss to the Plan within the time
specified will not invalidate or reduce any Claim if it is shown that the proof of loss was submitted as soon as
reasonably possible, but in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, will the Plan be required to
accept a proof of loss later than 24 months after the charge for Covered Services in this Contract is Incurred.
4. Submission of Claim Forms
The completed claim form, with all itemized bills attached, must be forwarded to the Plan at the address
appearing on the Member’s Identification Card in order to satisfy the requirement of submitting a written proof

complete and correct. Each claim form must be accompanied by itemized bills showing:
Person or organization providing the Service

above. The Plan reserves the right to require additional information and documents as needed to support a
claim that a Covered Service has been rendered.
Notice of the Plan’s claim determination will be issued within a reasonable period of time not to exceed thirty
(30) days following the receipt of a proper proof of loss. This period of time may be extended one (1) time by
the Plan for an additional period of time not to exceed fifteen (15) days provided the extension is due to
matters outside the control of the Plan and a written explanation for the delay is provided to the Member.
In the event that the Plan renders an adverse decision on the Claim, the notification shall include, among other
items, the specific reason or reasons for the adverse decision and a statement describing the right of the
Member to file an appeal.

Filing Benefit Claims
Authorized Representatives
l
You have the right to designate an authorized representative to file or pursue a request for
reimbursement or other post-service claim on your behalf. Highmark reserves the right to establish
reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been authorized to act on your behalf.
Requests for Preauthorization and Other Pre-Service Claims
l
When preauthorization is required under this program prior to receiving covered services from a network
provider, the network provider will contact Davis Vision, complete any required prior approval form and
submit any information necessary to request that services be preauthorized. If preauthorization is denied,
your network provider will inform you, and you have the right to file an appeal. The appeal process is
described in the Appeal Procedure section below.
If services requiring preauthorization are to be received from an out-of-network provider, the
out-of-network provider will not initiate the preauthorization process on your behalf. In that case, you
should ask the doctor to provide you with a letter explaining why the services you received were
medically necessary (letter of medical necessity). Attach the letter of medical necessity and copies of the
bill that you paid to your completed claim form and file that with Highmark in order to be reimbursed. You
will receive written notice of any decision on a request for preauthorization or other pre-service claim
within 15 days from the date Davis Vision receives your claim. However, this 15-day period of time may
21

be extended one time by Davis Vision for an additional 15 days if additional time is necessary due to
matters outside its control, and notifies you of the extension prior to the expiration of the initial 15-day
pre-service claim determination period. If an extension of time is necessary because you failed to submit
information necessary for Davis to make a decision on your pre-service claim, the notice of extension that
is sent to you will specifically describe the information that you must submit. In this event, you will have at
least 45 days in which to submit the information before a decision is made on your pre-service claim.
If your request for preauthorization or approval of any other pre-service claim is denied, you will receive
written notification of that denial which will include, among other items, the specific reason or reasons for
the adverse determination and a statement describing your right to file an appeal.
Requests for Reimbursement and Other Post-Service Claims
l
When you receive services from a network provider, the provider will report the services to Davis Vision
and payment will be made directly to the provider. Davis Vision will also notify the provider of any
amounts that you are required to pay in the form of a copayment. If you believe that the copayment
amount is not correct or that any portion of those amounts are covered under your benefit program, you
may file an appeal.
Determinations on Benefit Claims
*TOCLVL2*Determinations on Benefit Claims*TOCLVL2*
Notice of Adverse Benefit Determinations Involving Requests for Reimbursement and Other
Post-Service Claims
If you have submitted a post-service claim for services of an out-of-network provider, Davis Vision will notify
you in writing of its determination on your request for reimbursement or other post-service claim within a
reasonable period of time following receipt of your claim. That period of time will not exceed 30 days from the
date your claim was received. However, this 30-day period of time may be extended one time for an additional
15 days, provided that Davis Vision determines that the additional time is necessary due to matters outside its
control, and notifies you of the extension prior to the expiration of the initial 30-day post-service claim
determination period. If an extension of time is necessary because you failed to submit information necessary
for Davis Vision to make a decision on your post-service claim, the notice of extension that is sent to you will
specifically describe the information that you must submit. In this event, you will have at least 45 days in which
to submit the information before a decision is made on your post-service claim.
If your request for reimbursement or other post-service claim is denied, you will receive written notification of
that denial which will include, among other items, the specific reason or reasons for the adverse benefit
determination and a statement describing your right to file an appeal.
For a description of your right to file an appeal concerning an adverse benefit determination of a request for
reimbursement or any other post-service claim, see the Appeal Procedure subsection below.
Appeal Procedure
*TOCLVL2*Appeal Procedure*TOCLVL2*
If you receive notification that a claim has been denied, in whole or in part, you may appeal the decision. Your
appeal must be submitted to Highmark within 180 days from the date of your receipt of notification of the
adverse decision.
The appeal process involves one level of review. This process is mandatory and must be exhausted before
you are permitted to institute such action at law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction as may be
appropriate.
At any time during the appeal process, you may choose to designate an authorized representative to
participate in the appeal process on your behalf. You or your authorized representative shall notify Highmark in
writing of the designation. For purposes of the appeal process described below, “you” includes designees,
22

legal representatives and, in the case of a minor, parents entitled or authorized to act on your behalf. Highmark
reserves the right to establish reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been
authorized to act on your behalf.
At any time during the appeal process, you may contact the Member Service Department at the toll-free
telephone number listed on your ID card to inquire about the filing or status of your appeal.
Upon request, you may review all documents, records and other information relevant to your appeal and shall
have the right to submit or present additional evidence or testimony which includes any written or oral
statements, comments and/or remarks, documents, records, information, data or other material in support of
your appeal. Your appeal will be reviewed by a representative from the Member Service Department. The
representative shall not have been involved or be the subordinate of any individual that was involved in any
previous decision to deny the claim or matter which is the subject of your appeal. In rendering a decision on
your appeal, the Member Service Department will take into account all evidence, comments, documents,
records, and other information submitted by you without regard to whether such information was previously
submitted to or considered by Highmark. The Member Service Department will afford no deference to any prior
adverse decision on the claim which is the subject of your appeal.
In rendering a decision on an appeal that is based, in whole or in part, on medical judgment, the Member
Service Department will consult with a vision care professional who has appropriate training and experience
and who is different from and not the subordinate to any individual who was consulted in a prior review.
Each appeal will be promptly investigated and Highmark will provide written notification of its decision within
the following time frames:
l When the appeal involves a pre-service claim, within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the
medical circumstances not to exceed 30 days following receipt of the appeal;
l When the appeal involves a post-service claim, within a reasonable period of time not to exceed 60
days following receipt of the appeal.
In the event Highmark renders an adverse decision on your appeal, the notification shall include, among other
items, the specific reason or reasons for the adverse decision and a statement regarding your right to pursue
any applicable legal action, right to arbitration.

*WTOCLVL1*How We Protect Your Right to Confidentiality*TOCLVL1* e have established policies and procedures to protect the privacy of our members' protected health
information (&quot;PHI&quot;) in all forms, including PHI given verbally, from unauthorized or improper use. Some of the
ways we protect your privacy include not discussing PHI outside of our offices, e.g., in hallways, elevators, as
well as verifying your identity before we discuss PHI with you over the phone. As permitted by law, we may use
or disclose protected health information for treatment, payment and health care operations, such as: claims
management, routine audits, coordination of care, quality assessment and measurement, case management,
utilization review, performance measurement, customer service, credentialing, medical review and
underwriting. With the use of measurement data, we are able to manage members' health care needs, even
targeting certain individuals for quality improvement programs, such as health, wellness and disease
management programs.
If we ever use your protected health information for non-routine uses, we will ask you to give us your
permission by signing a special authorization form, except with regard to court orders and subpoenas.
You have the right to access the information your doctor has been keeping in your medical records, and any
such request should be directed first to your network physician.
You benefit from the many safeguards we have in place to protect the use of data we maintain. This includes
requiring our employees to sign statements in which they agree to protect your confidentiality, using computer
passwords to limit access to your protected health information, and including confidentiality language in our
contracts with physicians, hospitals, vendors and other health care providers.
Our Privacy Department review and approves policies regarding the handling of confidential information.
Recognizing that you have a right to privacy in all settings, we even inspect the privacy of examination rooms
when we conduct on-site visits to physicians' offices. It's all part of safeguarding the confidentiality of your
protected health information.

*PTOCLVL2*Payment For Network Covered Expenses*TOCLVL2* rofessional Services
Eye Examination and Refractive Services
When a network provider is used, payment for eye examinations and refractive services is based on the plan
allowance.
Payment for the eye examination is made directly to the provider and is accepted as payment in full. If the eye
examination is subject to a copayment, as indicated in the Covered services, you are responsible for paying
that copayment amount to the provider.
Low Vision Care Services
When a network provider is used, payment for low vision care services is based on the amount of the
provider's charge up to the program allowance.
Payment for low vision care services is also made directly to the provider. However, you are responsible for the
difference between the program allowance and the provider's charge.
Laser Vision Correction Services
When a network provider is used, benefits for laser vision correction services are made available in the form of
a percentage discount of the provider's charge. You are responsible for paying the entire discounted price to
the provider.
Post-Refractive Products
When a network provider is used, payment for post-refractive products is based on the plan allowance, the
amount of the provider's charge up to the program allowance or the discounted price which the provider has
agreed to accept in satisfaction of its charge.
Payment of the plan allowance is made directly to the provider and is accepted as payment-in-full. If the
covered post-refractive product is subject to a copayment, as indicated in the Covered Services, you are
responsible for paying that copayment amount to the provider.
If payment for the covered post-refractive product is made up to the program allowance, as indicated in the
Schedule of Benefits, you are responsible for any difference between that amount and the provider's charge.
For those post-refractive products that are provided in the form of a discounted price, as indicated in the
Covered services, you are responsible for paying the entire discounted price to the network provider.
Payment For Out-of-Network Covered Expenses
*WTOCLVL2*Payment For Out-of-Network Covered Expenses*TOCLVL2* hen an out-of-network provider is used, payment for covered expenses is based on the amount of the
provider's charge up to the program allowance, as indicated in the Covered services. You are responsible for
the difference between the program allowance and the provider's charge.
You may &quot;split&quot; your benefits by receiving your eye examination and eyeglasses (or contact lenses) on
different dates or through different provider locations, if desired. However, complete eyeglasses must be
obtained at one time and from one provider. Continuity of care will best be maintained when all available
services are obtained at one time from either a network or out-of-network provider.

for Covered Services rendered to a Member. When a Member receives Covered Services from a Network
Provider, it is the responsibility of the Network Provider to submit its claim to the Plan in accordance with the
terms of its participation agreement. Should the Network Provider fail to submit its claim in a timely manner or
otherwise satisfy the Plan’s requirements as they relate to the filing of claims, the Member will not be liable and
the Network Provider shall hold the Member harmless relative to payment of the Covered Services received by
the Member.
When Covered Services are received from other than a Network Provider, the Member is responsible for
submitting the claim to the Plan. In such instances, the Member must submit the claim in accordance with the
following procedures:

Covered Services in this Contract have been rendered to a Member. Written notice of a claim must be given to
the Plan within twenty (20) days or as soon as reasonably possible after Covered Services have been
rendered to the Member. Notice given by or on behalf of the Member to the Plan that includes information
sufficient to identify the Member that received the Covered Services shall constitute sufficient notice of a claim
to the Plan. The Member can give notice to the Plan by writing to the Member Services Department. The

provided to the Plan within ninety (90) days after the date of such loss. Proof of loss must include all data
necessary for the Plan to determine benefits. Failure to submit a proof of loss to the Plan within the time
specified will not invalidate or reduce any Claim if it is shown that the proof of loss was submitted as soon as
reasonably possible, but in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, will the Plan be required to
accept a proof of loss later than 24 months after the charge for Covered Services in this Contract is Incurred.

Filing Benefit Claims
Authorized Representatives
l
You have the right to designate an authorized representative to file or pursue a request for
reimbursement or other post-service claim on your behalf. Highmark reserves the right to establish
reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been authorized to act on your behalf.
Requests for Preauthorization and Other Pre-Service Claims
l
When preauthorization is required under this program prior to receiving covered services from a network
provider, the network provider will contact Davis Vision, complete any required prior approval form and
submit any information necessary to request that services be preauthorized. If preauthorization is denied,
your network provider will inform you, and you have the right to file an appeal. The appeal process is
described in the Appeal Procedure section below.
If services requiring preauthorization are to be received from an out-of-network provider, the
out-of-network provider will not initiate the preauthorization process on your behalf. In that case, you
should ask the doctor to provide you with a letter explaining why the services you received were
medically necessary (letter of medical necessity). Attach the letter of medical necessity and copies of the
bill that you paid to your completed claim form and file that with Highmark in order to be reimbursed. You
will receive written notice of any decision on a request for preauthorization or other pre-service claim
within 15 days from the date Davis Vision receives your claim. However, this 15-day period of time may
21</page>
    <page number="22">be extended one time by Davis Vision for an additional 15 days if additional time is necessary due to
matters outside its control, and notifies you of the extension prior to the expiration of the initial 15-day
pre-service claim determination period. If an extension of time is necessary because you failed to submit
information necessary for Davis to make a decision on your pre-service claim, the notice of extension that
is sent to you will specifically describe the information that you must submit. In this event, you will have at
least 45 days in which to submit the information before a decision is made on your pre-service claim.
If your request for preauthorization or approval of any other pre-service claim is denied, you will receive
written notification of that denial which will include, among other items, the specific reason or reasons for
the adverse determination and a statement describing your right to file an appeal.
Requests for Reimbursement and Other Post-Service Claims
l
When you receive services from a network provider, the provider will report the services to Davis Vision
and payment will be made directly to the provider. Davis Vision will also notify the provider of any
amounts that you are required to pay in the form of a copayment. If you believe that the copayment
amount is not correct or that any portion of those amounts are covered under your benefit program, you
may file an appeal.

reasonable period of time following receipt of your claim. That period of time will not exceed 30 days from the

15 days, provided that Davis Vision determines that the additional time is necessary due to matters outside its

to submit the information before a decision is made on your post-service claim.

appeal must be submitted to Highmark within 180 days from the date of your receipt of notification of the
adverse decision.
The appeal process involves one level of review. This process is mandatory and must be exhausted before
you are permitted to institute such action at law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction as may be
appropriate.
At any time during the appeal process, you may choose to designate an authorized representative to
participate in the appeal process on your behalf. You or your authorized representative shall notify Highmark in
writing of the designation. For purposes of the appeal process described below, “you” includes designees,
22</page>
    <page number="23">legal representatives and, in the case of a minor, parents entitled or authorized to act on your behalf. Highmark
reserves the right to establish reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been
authorized to act on your behalf.
At any time during the appeal process, you may contact the Member Service Department at the toll-free
telephone number listed on your ID card to inquire about the filing or status of your appeal.
Upon request, you may review all documents, records and other information relevant to your appeal and shall
have the right to submit or present additional evidence or testimony which includes any written or oral
statements, comments and/or remarks, documents, records, information, data or other material in support of
your appeal. Your appeal will be reviewed by a representative from the Member Service Department. The
representative shall not have been involved or be the subordinate of any individual that was involved in any
previous decision to deny the claim or matter which is the subject of your appeal. In rendering a decision on
your appeal, the Member Service Department will take into account all evidence, comments, documents,
records, and other information submitted by you without regard to whether such information was previously
submitted to or considered by Highmark. The Member Service Department will afford no deference to any prior
adverse decision on the claim which is the subject of your appeal.
In rendering a decision on an appeal that is based, in whole or in part, on medical judgment, the Member
Service Department will consult with a vision care professional who has appropriate training and experience
and who is different from and not the subordinate to any individual who was consulted in a prior review.
Each appeal will be promptly investigated and Highmark will provide written notification of its decision within
the following time frames:
l When the appeal involves a pre-service claim, within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the
medical circumstances not to exceed 30 days following receipt of the appeal;
l When the appeal involves a post-service claim, within a reasonable period of time not to exceed 60
days following receipt of the appeal.
In the event Highmark renders an adverse decision on your appeal, the notification shall include, among other
items, the specific reason or reasons for the adverse decision and a statement regarding your right to pursue
any applicable legal action, right to arbitration.

*TEMPLATE*CCBSPA_CERT_VISION*TEMPLATE*
*WTOCLVL1*How We Protect Your Right to Confidentiality*TOCLVL1* e have established policies and procedures to protect the privacy of our members' protected health
information (&quot;PHI&quot;) in all forms, including PHI given verbally, from unauthorized or improper use. Some of the
ways we protect your privacy include not discussing PHI outside of our offices, e.g., in hallways, elevators, as
well as verifying your identity before we discuss PHI with you over the phone. As permitted by law, we may use
or disclose protected health information for treatment, payment and health care operations, such as: claims
management, routine audits, coordination of care, quality assessment and measurement, case management,
utilization review, performance measurement, customer service, credentialing, medical review and
underwriting. With the use of measurement data, we are able to manage members' health care needs, even
targeting certain individuals for quality improvement programs, such as health, wellness and disease
management programs.
If we ever use your protected health information for non-routine uses, we will ask you to give us your
permission by signing a special authorization form, except with regard to court orders and subpoenas.
You have the right to access the information your doctor has been keeping in your medical records, and any
such request should be directed first to your network physician.
You benefit from the many safeguards we have in place to protect the use of data we maintain. This includes
requiring our employees to sign statements in which they agree to protect your confidentiality, using computer
passwords to limit access to your protected health information, and including confidentiality language in our
contracts with physicians, hospitals, vendors and other health care providers.
Our Privacy Department review and approves policies regarding the handling of confidential information.
Recognizing that you have a right to privacy in all settings, we even inspect the privacy of examination rooms
when we conduct on-site visits to physicians' offices. It's all part of safeguarding the confidentiality of your
protected health information.
