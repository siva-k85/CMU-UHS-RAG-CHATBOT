  <full_text>HOW TO USE AN
INTERNAL CONDOM
Internal condoms can be used to decrease risk of pregnancy
with vaginal sex, and decrease risk of sexually transmitted
infections with vaginal and anal sex.
Carefully open and remove the condom from package
The thick, inner ring with closed end is used for placing in the vagina
and holds condom in place. If using for anal sex, remove the inner
ring.
The thin, outer ring remains outside of body, covering vaginal or anal
opening.
While holding outside of condom at closed end, squeeze sides of inner
ring together with thumb and forefinger and insert into vagina.
If using for anal sex, use lube and guide the condom into the anus
using a toy or erect penis.
*** This step is for vaginal use only: Using your finger, push inner ring
as far up as it will go until it rests against cervix. The condom will
expand naturally and you may not feel it.
Be sure condom is not twisted. The thin, outer ring should remain
outside of the body.
Guide penis or toy into opening of the condom. Stop intercourse if you
feel penis slip between condom and inside of your body, or if outer ring
is pushed into your body.
To remove, gently twist outer ring and pull condom out of body.
Throw away the condom in trash after using it one time. Do not
reuse.
