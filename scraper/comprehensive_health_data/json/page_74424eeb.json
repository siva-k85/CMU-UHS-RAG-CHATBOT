Contact\nthe\nStudent Health Insurance Team\n.\nFinding Care\nThe CMU SHIP is a national plan, with participating in-network providers in every state.\nI\nf you have an emergency,\ncall 911 or go to your closest emergency room.\nFor routine care\n, University Health Services (UHS) does not recommend specific providers, but if you are in need of non-urgent care:\nFor Pittsburgh based students: call UHS and speak with a member of the medical team (412-268-2157, option 2). The medical staff can help you make an appointment at UHS or refer you to a specialist. You can find more information on the\nUHS Services and Fees page\n.\nCall your insurance plan's Member Services number to find participating providers and answer questions about coverage. Phone numbers can be found on the back of your insurance member ID card(s).\nSearch for medical\n, dental and vision care via the\nHighmark portal\n:\nLog in/register (using your member ID number)\nSelect\nFind Doctors and Rx\nSelect\nFind a Doctor or Hospital / Find a Vision Care Provider / Find a Dentist\nfor medical services, choose the\nBCBS PPO\nnetwork\nfor dental services, choose the\nElite Plus\nnetwork\nEnter location\nSelect the category of care\nSearch for telemedecine/virtual services in the\nMy Highmark\nApp. Well360 Virtual Health is located the\nGet Care\nsection. Services include:\nBehavioral Health\n24/7 Medical Care\nPrescriptions and refills\nBefore scheduling any appointment, verify directly with each provider or facility that they participate in the CMU SHIP network.\nTo locate a\npharmacy:\nLog in/register with Highmark (using your member ID number)\nSelect\nFind Doctors and Rx\nGot to\nFind a Pharmacy\nand select\nNational Plus Network Pharmacy\nCare while Abroad\nIf you are living or traveling abroad, the CMU SHIP medical plan also provides members with a global network of healthcare providers through\nBCBS Global Core\n, along with 24 hour emergency medical and travel assistance through the\nAXA Travel Assistance Program\n.\nGoing to Your Appointment\nWhen you are in need of medical services, the first step is to\nfind a provider\n. When you are ready to go to your appointment, remember the following:\nBring your insurance member ID card. The office will likely ask you for your card, and you might need it for any required paperwork. Arrive a few minutes early to allow time for this process.\nIf you do not have your physical card, you can\nregister with Highmark\nand order a new ID card, or download a digital copy.\nHave the name and address of your\npharmacy\nfor any medication that needs to be ordered.\nIf going for a first-time visit, gather any relevant medical records, lab results, or scans (such as X-rays or MRIs) to bring with you to the appointment. It is also helpful to bring a list of any current medications.\nIf the provider prescribes further testing (such as a scan or lab work), you should have that order with you when you leave the office. Schedule testing with an\nin-network provider\n.\nBe prepared to pay a\ncopay\nfor non-routine visits.
