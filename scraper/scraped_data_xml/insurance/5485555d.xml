      <paragraph>All straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, transgender, single, partnered and polyamorous individuals should have an annual health exam.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Sexually active individuals 21 years of age or older with female reproductive organs should also have an annual gynecological exam. Gynecology is health care for the female reproductive system.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Whether you want to prevent pregnancy, consider pregnancy, or learn about what options you have for an unplanned pregnancy, UHS is here to help.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>UHS offers many safe and effective birth control methods, including Kyleena, Mirena, and Paragard intrauterine devices (IUDs), Nexplanon implant, birth control pills, patches, vaginal ring, and Depo-provera shot,  We recommend learning about all of your options. Check out Bedsider and Planned Parenthood's Birth Control Effectiveness Chart and My Method, tools to help you decide which type is best for you.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>All CMU students are welcome to be seen at UHS to discuss birth control options. UHS Student Health Insurance (SHIP) covers all forms of birth control and if you have private insurance we can help you check what is covered.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>There are three types of Emergency Contraception (EC), and the most effective type depends on timing of unprotected sex and your weight.  EC works to prevent pregnancy and is not an abortion medication.  If you have any concern that you may be pregnant, please check a pregnancy test first.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Emergency Contraception at UHS: UHS offers all 3 types of EC directly from our health center or you can get levonorgestrel (generic Plan B) from one of our 3 UHS Wellness To Go Vending Machines on campus.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Either partner can get EC at UHS, without an appointment.To request EC from UHS login to HealthConnect--&gt; select messages--&gt;new message--&gt; emergency contraception request. EC works best when taken as early as possible. When UHS is open, we do our best to have your medication ready by end of day.  If you are requesting this medication when UHS is closed, there will be a delay in processing the request.   If you do not want to wait to take the medication, please go to a Wellness to Go Vending Machine or a  local pharmacy to purchase generic Plan B.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you are not sure what your best option is or want to schedule an appointment to discuss this medication or other birth control options, please call us: 412-268-2157, option 2.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>UHS offers some pre-pregnancy health services for students who are considering pregnancy or are recently pregnant. If you are planning a pregnancy, please schedule either a women's annual exam or a wellness exam to talk with a healthcare provider. We can also provide referrals for prenatal care.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>UHS staff are available to listen and answer questions in a supportive, non-judgmental and confidential manner. If you are pregnant, there are three options available. UHS can provide information and referrals for any option you choose:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology offers a comprehensive set of Frequently Asked Questions on Pregnancy Choices.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are very common. By age 25, about half of all sexually active young people will get one. STIs often show no symptoms, so many people who have one don't know it. The only way to know if you or a partner have an STI is to get tested and knowing helps you protect each other.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a daily HIV prevention treatment for people who have multiple sexual partners. PrEP is available at UHS and is covered by CMU SHIP, our student health insurance plan. Those with outside insurane should check to find out if PrEP is covered and what costs might apply. Students can make appointments to start or continue PrEP by calling 412-268-2157 (select option 2).</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Chlamydia: urine sample and/or rectal swab</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV): blood sample or oral swab</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Gonorrhea: urine sample, rectal swab and/or throat swab</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Syphilis: blood sample</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Abstain from sexual activity with any partner until you are examined. Schedule an appointment for a physical exam at University Health Services.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>University Health Services offers expedited partner therapy for chlamydia infection. That means that you or your partner can receive treatment quickly if either of you has been diagnosed with chlamydia.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>There are many effective options [pdf] for preventing pregnancy.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Any form of hormonal contraception (birth control), should be used with a barrier (condom, etc.) 100% of the time for the best protection against STIs.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Many birth control methods are available at UHS. Schedule an appointment with us to talk about birth control options.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>UHS offers emergency contraception, sometimes called Plan B or “The Morning after Pill.&quot; This can be taken by females up to five days after unprotected sex, but is most effective if taken within the first three days.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Any student can get emergency contraception at UHS without an appointment. Stop by our office and check in at the kiosk in the waiting room to see a nurse who can assist you.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>This medicine is also available over-the-counter at local pharmacies.</paragraph>

Crisis Pregnancy Centers are often confused as an abortion resource, but do not provide abortions and may discourage patients from ending a pregnancy. They may also be called something other than a Crisis Pregnancy Center.

Full coverage is provided for abortion services (facility and professional) through the Highmark Student Health Insurance Plan.</item>
