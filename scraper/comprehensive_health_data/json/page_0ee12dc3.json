  "main_content": "Healthcare for LGBTQIA+ Students\nLGBTQIA+ students can receive general medical care, as well as specialized care, at University Health Services. This video shares a wealth of information about the ways UHS supports trans students:\nGeneral Medical Care\nWe encourage LGBTQIA+ students to receive routine care. Specifically, UHS recommends that students follow guidelines for routine screening of sex-specific organs, like pap smears/gynecological exams, breast exams, prostate exams, etc. If you are uncomfortable with these types of exams, we are happy to talk with you about how to make them easier.\nSpecialized Care\nGender Affirming Care Navigation Appointments\nUHS now offers Gender Affirming Care Navigation Appointments! Meet with a Health Promotion Specialist to receive gender identity-related support, such as: name change (legal and within CMU), mental health provider referrals, medical provider referrals, sexual health, HRT support, finding surgery providers, obtaining letters for surgeries, basic health insurance info/support, a listening ear, and more. Schedule your appointment through HealthConnect or by calling 412-268-2127 (select option 2).\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis is a new HIV prevention treatment. Taking PrEP once daily significantly lowers the risk of HIV transmission. PrEP is covered by the SHIP, CMU's student health insurance plan. Those with outside insurance should check to find out if PrEP is covered and what costs might apply. Additionally,\nthe federal government\nannounced\nin July of 2021 that almost all health insurers must cover the HIV prevention pill, known as PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, with no cost sharing — including for the drug itself and, crucially, for clinic visits and lab tests.\nStudents can make appointments to start or continue PrEP by calling 412-268-2157 (select option 2).\nLearn more about PrEP.\nHormone Therapy\nUHS provides hormone therapy  for transgender students using the informed consent model. Hormone therapy is covered by the SHIP, CMU's student health insurance plan. Students can make appointments to start or continue Hormone therapy by calling 412-268-2157 (select option 2).\nInformed consent is an evidence-based model of providing care that is used in healthcare agencies serving and run primarily by LGBTQIA+ and trans and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) communities. This means that UHS does not require a student to get a letter from a mental health provider in support of hormones as long as they can provide informed consent for care. A student can provide informed consent if they have correct information about hormone therapy; are able to understand the information about hormone therapy that has been provided, including risks and benefits as well as reversible and irreversible effects; and/or are able to use this information to make a decision.\nThe informed consent model is consistent with WPATH Standards of Care and reduces barriers to accessing medically necessary treatment. In this model, students are given accurate and comprehensive information about hormone therapy and will be supported in making the decision that is right for them. Please note that providing care in an informed consent model does not mean that hormones are available on demand. If a medical provider determines that a student has a medical or psychological condition that might preclude the initiation of hormones until further evaluation or treatment, the student be will referred to the appropriate medical and/or psychological resources for further evaluation.\nConnection to LGBTQIA+ Substance Use Resources\nThere are many substance use resources in the Pittsburgh community.\nThis Young People and LGBTQIA+ Friendly 12-Step Meetings list\nincludes information about local peer-to-peer meetings and treatment centers that center LGBTQIA+ folks. For more information about recovery and harm reduction at CMU, please visit the\nCMU Collegiate Recovery & Harm Reduction webpage\n.\nName, gender and sex assigned at birth documentation\nUHS can include chosen name*, gender identity and sex assigned at birth in medical records. If you have a chosen* name documented in\nStudent Information Online (SIO)\n, UHS automatically receives this information. You can\nalso\nupdate your pronouns, name and gender identity in HealthConnect, or ask us to make these updates during a visit to UHS.\n*SIO and HealthConnect use the term \"preferred name,\" whereas we know community members recognize that the names we give ourselves are not just \"preferred,\" they're our chosen names.\nTrans Health Zine\nThis zine is made for you to help you navigate University Health Services at Carnegie Mellon University, as trans, non-binary, or gender-nonconforming (GNC) student.\nCarnegie Mellon’s\nstudent health insurance plan, SHIP\n,\noffers transgender inclusive coverage. Explore what the\nthe plan offers for gender confirmation surgery coverage.\nIf you have an outside plan, check with your plan to find out what is covered.\nTransgender Inclusive Coverage: Insurance & Policy Resources\nFinding Insurance\nTransgender Healthcare\nHealthcare Rights\nContact Information\nQuestions and concerns about LGBTQIA+ health can be directed to one of our Health Promotion Specialists by emailing\nhealthpromotion@andrew.cmu.edu\nor by scheduling a Gender Affirming Care Navigation appointment through HealthConnect.
