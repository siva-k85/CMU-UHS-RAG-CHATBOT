Ramadan Mubarek
RamadanÂ began the evening of Sunday, March 10th, and ends the evening of Tuesday, April 9th.
Celebrated by Muslims around the world and considered one of the Five Pillars of Islam, the annual observance is held in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and is a time for fasting, reflection, charity and prayer.
UHS vows to support Muslim patients observing Ramadan by:
Communicating with patients about what is needed for them to receive the best medical care possible, listening to their preferences, and discussing care options that will align with their observance of Ramadan.
Exploring whether a minor procedure can be performed after Ramadan.
Exploring changing dosing frequency to once or twice daily, changing to long-acting formulations or choosing a different medication administration for patients on medication to allow them to observe Ramadan while maintaining their treatment requirements.
