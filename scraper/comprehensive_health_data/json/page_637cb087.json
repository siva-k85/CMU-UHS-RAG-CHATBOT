If someone forces or manipulates someone else into any kind of unwanted sexual activity without their consent, it is sexual violence. Reasons someone may not be able to consent include fear, age, illness, disability, and/or influence of alcohol or other drugs. Many definitions related to consent and sexual violence may be found on\nThe Office of Institutional Equity & Title IX’s webpage\n.\nAnyone can experience sexual violence, and it is never their fault.\nIf you are unsure if what you have experienced or are experiencing is considered sexual violence, you can schedule a confidential meeting with\nCaPS\n, or connect with\nPittsburgh Action Against Rape\n(PAAR) or\nRape, Abuse & Incest National Network\n(RAINN) to talk with someone who can listen and help.\nMedical Care and Sexual Assault\nWe recommend receiving immediate attention and care in the emergency department following a sexual trauma. If you are in Pittsburgh, UPMC Magee is the best option. Your insurance will not be charged, and you won’t have to pay for any medications. In the emergency department you can receive care and complete evidence collection, regardless of whether you report to police or not. In the emergency department, you have access to:\nChecking for injuries and receiving medical attention\nCompleting a sexual assault exam to collect evidence\nReceiving emergency contraception and prophylactic medication to prevent STIs and HIV\nIt is important to follow up with UHS clinicians, your primary care provider or an outpatient clinic. If you would like help in connecting to a provider, contact PAAR: 1-866-363-7273.\nSexual Assault Forensic Examination Kit\nA sexual assault exam (sometimes called the “kit”) is a medical exam and collection of forensic evidence. It attempts to collect evidence to use in the prosecution of an alleged sexual assault. You can complete the exam/(have evidence collected) with or without reporting the incident to police.\nA forensic exam can do two things:\nprovide sensitive, thorough medical care after an alleged sexual assault including physical exam and medication to prevent sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy if applicable\ncollect evidence that is admissible in court and may be helpful to the prosecution of a legal case, in the case that you decide to report to law enforcement\nThe sooner you get to the hospital after an assault, the more options are available to you. It is recommended that you go to the hospital within 7 days of the incident. Try not to bathe, shower, brush your teeth, or go to the bathroom. This is important for preserving evidence. If you already have, it is still possible to collect evidence.\nIf possible, do not change your clothes. If you already have, put your clothes in a clean paper bag and bring them with you to the hospital.\nGo directly to UPMC Magee-Women’s Hospital. This hospital provides forensic exams for people of all genders.\nUPMC Magee Emergency Room: 300 Craft Ave., Pittsburgh, PA 15213, 412-641-4950\nIn-person support is available 24 hours a day in emergency departments throughout Allegheny County.\nPAAR\nprovides in-person support and information during the sexual assault exam. To request that an advocate meet you at the hospital, contact PAAR’s Helpline at 1-866-END-RAPE (1-866-363-7273).\nYou have the option to receive immediate attention and care including checking for injuries. You could also choose to complete a sexual assault exam for the collection of evidence. You have the option to report to the police – You can receive care and complete the evidence collection whether you report to police or not.\nPregnancy Prevention: Emergency Contraception\nEmergency Contraception (EC) is a safe way to prevent pregnancy following a sexual assault, after unprotected sex or when a contraceptive method may have failed (eg. a condom breaking or missing two or more birth control pills).\nImportant Information:\nEC prevents pregnancy before it occurs.\nThe earlier you take EC, the more likely it is to work – it is recommended to use EC within 72 hours (3 days).\nEC will not end an existing pregnancy\nEC does not work if you are already pregnant. Pregnancy test may be completed prior to giving the EC.\nEC is not as effective in preventing pregnancy as a birth control method used consistently and correctly.\nEC is available for $7 in all of the three\nWellness to Go vending machines\non campus.\nMore information about EC is available here.\nSexually Transmitted Infections (STIs/STDs):\nSexual assault could expose someone to Sexually Transmitted Infection (STIs). Emergency departments will offer prophylactic medication to prevent STIs and HIV following a sexual assault.\nPost-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention\nPost-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is a regimen of antiretroviral drugs that is designed to isolate the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), stop its replication and the establishment of infection. However, PEP only works to protect you within 72 hours of exposure. If you think you may have been exposed to HIV (through any means), contact\nAllies for Health + Wellbeing\n(412- 345-7456) or go to an emergency room within 72 hours to access PEP.\nPlanning Follow-Up Testing Services:\nSTIs are infections that are spread from one person to another, usually during vaginal, anal, or oral sex.\nMore Information\nabout STIs. Lots of people who have STIs don’t have any symptoms, and without treatment, STIs can lead to serious health problems. All STIs are treatable, and many are curable, so it’s important to receive testing to know your status and get the care you need. Testing is generally recommended 2-4 weeks after potential exposure.\nTesting in the Pittsburgh area:\nMany people are concerned about using their insurance for STI testing. The following Pittsburgh resources provide free testing services during select days and hours without going through insurance:\nPittsburgh Action Against Rape\nAllies for Health + Wellbeing\nAllegheny County Public Health Clinic\nUniversity Health Services can provide free testing for folks who have recently experienced sexual assault. Please ask your provider about the TEAL process. If you would like to schedule an appointment for testing, login to\nHealthConnect\nor call UHS at 412-268-2157.\nSexual Violence and Marginalization\nIndividuals with marginalized identities are at a greater risk for sexual violence. Those with multiple marginalized identities are at the greatest risk. Oppression, bias, stereotypes, and access to basic needs like housing, food, healthcare are contributing factors to these disparities. More information around statistics may be\nfound here\n.\nIdentity Specific Organizations:\nThe needs and experiences of survivors and communities are varied. The following organizations focus specifically on meeting the unique needs of specific communities and groups:\n1in 6\nfocuses on facilitating spaces for male survivors to heal together\nCasa de Esperanza\nprovides support for Latin@ and Latinx survivors and communities.\nJust Detention International\nadvocates for the safety and dignity of people in prisons, jail, and detention.\nBlack Women’s Blueprint\nempowers black women and girls to address how historic abuses continue to have an ongoing impact – from the legacy of slavery to sexual and reproductive exploitation, and police violence. They also take on initiatives to celebrate the experiences and contributions of individuals of African descent and redefine concepts of healing and justice from the perspectives of black survivors\nPittsburgh Action Against Rape\noffers identity specific support groups\nTitle IX\nis a U.S. civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education.\nThe Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX\nis responsible for coordinating the University’s effort’s to prevent and effectively respond to all forms of gender discrimination (including gender identity discrimination) and sexual misconduct impacting community members, including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, dating and domestic violence, and stalking.\nAfter Sexual Assault\nIt’s hard to know what to do, how to feel, or what your options are after a sexual assault. Please know that you’re not alone. If you are in immediate danger or seriously injured, call 911. Below are some things to keep in mind.\nYour safety is important. Are you in a safe place? If you’re not feeling safe, consider reaching out to someone you trust for support. You don’t have to go through this alone.\nWhat happened was not your fault. Something happened to you that you didn’t want to happen—and that’s not OK.\nCall the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800.656.HOPE (4673). You’ll be connected to a trained staff member from a local sexual assault service provider in your area. They will direct you to the appropriate local health facility that can care for survivors of sexual assault. Some service providers may be able to send a trained advocate to accompany you.\nWhen you call the National Sexual Assault Hotline, a staff member will walk you through the process of getting help at your own pace. You can also visit online.rainn.org to chat anonymously. Support specialists can also provide information on topics you might have questions about.\nHelp and support are available regardless of when the violence may have occurred or if the statute of limitations for prosecution has ended.

Read more about this process under “Resources and Support - Confidentiality.”\nWhat to expect after a report:\nWhen the University receives a report of sexual misconduct or other types of discrimination, the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX will:\nReview and document the report\nAttempt to contact the impacted party to offer support, resources, and information about options\nIn general, follow the impacted party’s wishes about next steps, including if the University takes any action, such as notifying the party accused of misconduct and whether to investigate the concerns.\nYou choose what happens next. In very limited circumstances, the University may be required to take additional steps to protect the campus community. For example, the University may need to investigate if there are multiple reports of similar conduct against one individual. Additionally, if there is a crime reported to have occurred on or near campus that represents a possible threat to the community, University Police may need to send out a “timely warning” to the community; the warning will not include identifying information about the impacted party.\nWhat’s the difference between a report and a formal complaint?\nThe Office accepts reports of prohibited conduct from anyone at any time. A report is information provided to the Office regarding one or more incidents of prohibited conduct. Whether the person making the report decides to pursue an investigation or other resolution, or to not take any further action, is ultimately up to their own discretion. A Formal Complaint is a signed, written or typed document, requesting that the University initiate a formal investigation into the alleged prohibited misconduct.\nFor more detailed information regarding University reporting, formal complaints, and investigative processes, contact the\nOffice of Institutional Equity and Title IX\noffice. You may review this\nresource guide\nfor more detailed information.\nResources and Support\nThere is never one way to heal from\ntrauma\nor\ncomplex trauma\nand healing can often be confusing, difficult and nonlinear.

What this means is that if sexual violence is disclosed to a faculty or staff person, regardless of whether the incident just happened, or occurred years in the past, faculty and staff must report the incident to The Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX.\nIf someone is a confidential reporter, then that report can be made without any details or identifiable information.\nIf someone is a mandated reporter, then that report must contain identifying information\n. A staff member from The Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX will reach out to the person identified in the report. It is up to that person to respond or not.
