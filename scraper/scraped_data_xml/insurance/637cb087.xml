    <paragraphs>
      <paragraph>The term &quot;sexual violence&quot; is an all-encompassing, non-legal term that refers to crimes like sexual assault, rape, and sexual abuse. If someone forces or manipulates someone else into any kind of unwanted sexual activity without their consent, it is sexual violence. Reasons someone may not be able to consent include fear, age, illness, disability, and/or influence of alcohol or other drugs. Many definitions related to consent and sexual violence may be found on The Office of Institutional Equity &amp; Title IX’s webpage.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Anyone can experience sexual violence, and it is never their fault. If you are unsure if what you have experienced or are experiencing is considered sexual violence, you can schedule a confidential meeting with CaPS, or connect with Pittsburgh Action Against Rape (PAAR) or Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN) to talk with someone who can listen and help.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>We recommend receiving immediate attention and care in the emergency department following a sexual trauma. If you are in Pittsburgh, UPMC Magee is the best option. Your insurance will not be charged, and you won’t have to pay for any medications. In the emergency department you can receive care and complete evidence collection, regardless of whether you report to police or not. In the emergency department, you have access to:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>It is important to follow up with UHS clinicians, your primary care provider or an outpatient clinic. If you would like help in connecting to a provider, contact PAAR: 1-866-363-7273.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>A sexual assault exam (sometimes called the “kit”) is a medical exam and collection of forensic evidence. It attempts to collect evidence to use in the prosecution of an alleged sexual assault. You can complete the exam/(have evidence collected) with or without reporting the incident to police.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>A forensic exam can do two things:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The sooner you get to the hospital after an assault, the more options are available to you. It is recommended that you go to the hospital within 7 days of the incident. Try not to bathe, shower, brush your teeth, or go to the bathroom. This is important for preserving evidence. If you already have, it is still possible to collect evidence.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>In-person support is available 24 hours a day in emergency departments throughout Allegheny County. PAAR provides in-person support and information during the sexual assault exam. To request that an advocate meet you at the hospital, contact PAAR’s Helpline at 1-866-END-RAPE (1-866-363-7273).</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Emergency Contraception (EC) is a safe way to prevent pregnancy following a sexual assault, after unprotected sex or when a contraceptive method may have failed (eg. a condom breaking or missing two or more birth control pills).</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Important Information:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>EC is available for $7 in all of the three Wellness to Go vending machines on campus. More information about EC is available here.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Sexual assault could expose someone to Sexually Transmitted Infection (STIs). Emergency departments will offer prophylactic medication to prevent STIs and HIV following a sexual assault.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Post-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is a regimen of antiretroviral drugs that is designed to isolate the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), stop its replication and the establishment of infection. However, PEP only works to protect you within 72 hours of exposure. If you think you may have been exposed to HIV (through any means), contact Allies for Health + Wellbeing (412- 345-7456) or go to an emergency room within 72 hours to access PEP.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Many people are concerned about using their insurance for STI testing. The following Pittsburgh resources provide free testing services during select days and hours without going through insurance:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Individuals with marginalized identities are at a greater risk for sexual violence. Those with multiple marginalized identities are at the greatest risk. Oppression, bias, stereotypes, and access to basic needs like housing, food, healthcare are contributing factors to these disparities. More information around statistics may be found here.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Identity Specific Organizations:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The needs and experiences of survivors and communities are varied. The following organizations focus specifically on meeting the unique needs of specific communities and groups:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Title IX is a U.S. civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education. The Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX is responsible for coordinating the University’s effort’s to prevent and effectively respond to all forms of gender discrimination (including gender identity discrimination) and sexual misconduct impacting community members, including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, dating and domestic violence, and stalking.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>It’s hard to know what to do, how to feel, or what your options are after a sexual assault. Please know that you’re not alone. If you are in immediate danger or seriously injured, call 911. Below are some things to keep in mind.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>When you call the National Sexual Assault Hotline, a staff member will walk you through the process of getting help at your own pace. You can also visit online.rainn.org to chat anonymously. Support specialists can also provide information on topics you might have questions about.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Help and support are available regardless of when the violence may have occurred or if the statute of limitations for prosecution has ended. Consider connecting with Pittsburgh Action Against Rape and the National Sexual Assault Hotline to understand what resources best suit your needs.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Anyone can make a report for themselves or someone else with the Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX by completing the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX Report Form, calling, emailing, or visiting the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If staff and faculty know about an incident, they are required to submit a report to the Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX. Read more about this process under “Resources and Support - Confidentiality.”</paragraph>
      <paragraph>When the University receives a report of sexual misconduct or other types of discrimination, the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX will:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>You choose what happens next. In very limited circumstances, the University may be required to take additional steps to protect the campus community. For example, the University may need to investigate if there are multiple reports of similar conduct against one individual. Additionally, if there is a crime reported to have occurred on or near campus that represents a possible threat to the community, University Police may need to send out a “timely warning” to the community; the warning will not include identifying information about the impacted party.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>What’s the difference between a report and a formal complaint?</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The Office accepts reports of prohibited conduct from anyone at any time. A report is information provided to the Office regarding one or more incidents of prohibited conduct. Whether the person making the report decides to pursue an investigation or other resolution, or to not take any further action, is ultimately up to their own discretion. A Formal Complaint is a signed, written or typed document, requesting that the University initiate a formal investigation into the alleged prohibited misconduct.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>For more detailed information regarding University reporting, formal complaints, and investigative processes, contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX office. You may review this resource guide for more detailed information.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>There is never one way to heal from trauma or complex trauma and healing can often be confusing, difficult and nonlinear. It is okay to struggle or seek help from others when healing from sexual violence. Fortunately, there are many different types of resources available. If you have any questions about what types of resources will be the most helpful for you, here are some people you can talk to: Peer Health Advocates, CAPS, or Health Promotion.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Faculty and staff in higher education are either mandated reporters or confidential reporters. What this means is that if sexual violence is disclosed to a faculty or staff person, regardless of whether the incident just happened, or occurred years in the past, faculty and staff must report the incident to The Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If someone is a confidential reporter, then that report can be made without any details or identifiable information.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If someone is a mandated reporter, then that report must contain identifying information. A staff member from The Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX will reach out to the person identified in the report. It is up to that person to respond or not. If someone chooses not to respond, then that is the end of the process.</paragraph>
