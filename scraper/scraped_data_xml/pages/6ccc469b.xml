  <full_text>Do the people you are intimate with…
✔✔Ask what you want when it comes to sex and respect your
boundaries? Most sexual assaults are committed by someone
the survivor knows. No one should pressure or force you into
doing anything sexual or harm you physically.
✔✔Support your independence and interests? No one should
keep you from your social life, work, or educational goals.
Sex should feel good for all partners and healthy
relationships are ones that are supportive.
But what about when our boundaries are not respected?
You are not alone
Sexual assault and dating violence are not OK, but they are
common. If you or someone you know has experienced an
assault or abuse, support is available.
Connect with an advocate: For confidential
counseling, safety planning, support groups,
reporting options, and legal advocacy.
Visit your campus health center or local health
provider: For mental health support, STI/HIV
testing and treatment (including PrEP/PEP), info
on emergency contraception (the morning after
pill/Plan B) to prevent pregnancy, and more.
Know your Title IX office: If you decide to report,
this office investigates sexual violence and sexual
harassment. Be aware that some school staff,
professors, RAs, coaches, etc. may be required
to notify the Title IX office if they hear about an
incident.
No matter who caused the harm - a friend, date, partner,
classmate, or someone at a party - survivors are often made
to feel like what happened was their fault or not a big deal.
It is never a survivor’s fault and their experiences are valid.
Talking to someone you trust can be a first step in healing.
You don’t have to go through this alone.
Your health and wellness
✔✔Do you often feel depressed or anxious?
✔✔Are you drinking, smoking, or using drugs more to cope?
✔✔Have you noticed changes in your appetite or sleep habits?
✔✔Has getting to class, finishing school work, or participating
in other activities been more difficult than usual?
✔✔Do you ever think about hurting yourself?
Reactions like these are common for people who have
experienced sexual/dating violence. It could be helpful to talk
to a health provider or an advocate about what is going on.
Helping a friend
Listen and don’t judge. Sexual assault and dating
violence can make a survivor feel powerless and alone.
“You are not alone and nothing you did or didn’t do
caused this to happen. I am here for you - what can I
do to help?”
Don’t pressure them to take steps they aren’t ready for
or don’t want to do. Call the hotlines on this card or
seek out a confidential resource on campus for more
tips on how to support a friend.

Culture of consent
How can everyone on campus promote a culture of consent,
support survivors, and hold those who use violence or
coercion accountable?
Consent is an active, voluntary agreement that can be
revoked at any time.
✔✔Even if you have had sex with someone before, it’s still
important to ask for consent every time. Over half of sexual
assaults occur within ongoing relationships.
✔✔If a person is drunk, high, asleep, or too afraid to say no,
they can’t give consent.
Take action!
✔✔Lead by example: “Can I kiss you?” Always ask for
consent before kissing or touching. Ask them how
they feel and respect their answer, even if it means
you might not get what you want.
✔✔Be an active bystander: When you see something
that doesn’t seem right, speak up! It can be as simple
as calling out rape jokes/harassment, or stepping in
if someone looks like they’re trying to hook up with
someone who is too drunk to give consent.
✔✔Get involved: Advocate with your administration
and student government for survivor-centered
policies and prevention programs.
✔✔Challenge gender norms: Harmful gender norms --
like assuming men always want sex, thinking LGBQ
people don’t experience abuse, believing women
are “asking for it,” or ignoring trans and gender
non-binary identities -- contribute to sexual/dating
violence.
