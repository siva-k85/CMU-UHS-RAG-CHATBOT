      <paragraph>Students are seen by appointment only.  Same-day appointments are available on a limited basis depending on availability. We always do our best to work with patients with acute illnesses and injuries. To increase the likelihood of being seen sooner please contact us as early as possible.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If no appointments are available, students will be assessed by a triage nurse and provided with an appropriate plan of care which may include: guidance on symptom management; referrals to urgent/emergency care; scheduling for the next available appointment.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>We offer primary medical care, health promotion and insurance services for all currently enrolled students. UHS does not see employees or former students. Explore this page for a listing of UHS services (and fees), many of which are now being offered virtually.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you need a medical appointment, or to speak with a nurse, call UHS at 412-268-2157, Option 2.  Students can also schedule many UHS based appointments through HealthConnect.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Our Comprehensive Care Coordinator helps students identify and coordinate services to meet their health and academic support needs. The CCM works with Academic Development, Counseling and Psychological Services, Disability Resources, Housing Services, Dining Services and other campus offices. This free service is available to all students who:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Contact our Comprehensive Care Coordinator.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Services include, but not limited to:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Available for students who would like support with communicating with their provider during appointments. Trained healthcare interpreters are available for many languages, including Mandarin, Hindi, Korean and American Sign Language.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Students may request this service during any visit.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>LGBTQIA+ students can receive general medical care as well as specialized services at UHS.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Contact Health Promotion with questions. Trans and non-binary students can also schedule a gender-affirming care navigation appointment on HealthConnect.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Medication Disposal is available at CMUPD's main office 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Medications should be brought to the drop box in the lobby at 4551 Filmore Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Immunization records, test results, statements and after-visit summaries are all available to download/print from HealthConnect.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Students can consult with the UHS dietitian for assistance with the following:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you have medical condition that requires a dining plan accommodation, complete the Special Dining Needs form (pdf).</paragraph>
      <paragraph>UHS can provide a refill if an existing prescription is on record at UHS, and the prescription is still valid.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you are out of refills, bring in a new prescription or contact your provider through HealthConnect to obtain a new prescription. Refills will be ready for pick-up two business days after a request is received.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Request refills, via &quot;messages&quot;, in HealthConnect</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Services include, but not limited to:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Many immunizations and vaccines are available at UHS, including Tuberculosis Testing.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>For students who are traveling, UHS administers Oral Typhoid (by prescription), and prescribes anti-malarial medication. We do not offer a Yellow Fever vaccine.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>University Health Services (UHS) sees all enrolled students, regardless if you have the CMU Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), or an outside insurance plan.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>UHS does not bill outside insurance plans, so students not enrolled in the SHIP must submit a claim to their insurance plan for reimbursement.</paragraph>

      <paragraph>2. Medications dispensed from UHS will incur a charge:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>3. Laboratory testing sent outside of UHS is processed by Quest Diagnostics and will incur a copay, on top of any non-covered charges:</paragraph>
