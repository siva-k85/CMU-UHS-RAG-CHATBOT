Cancellations are by\nrequest only, and allowed under the following circumstances:\nDecember Graduation (or a Fall certification for doctoral students graduating in December).\nFormal separation from CMU (i.e. leave of absence, w\nithdrawal, suspension).\nFall semester foreign exchange students returning to their university after the Fall semester.\nEnrollment in Medicaid in the area in which you are studying (e.g., a Pittsburgh campus student approved for PA Medicaid). Enrollment is based on eligibility and the application process can be lengthy. Students must also have applied for Medicaid before or during their open enrollment period.\nThe option to join a new plan does not make a student eligible to cancel their current insurance enrollment.\nIf you meet this criterion,\ncontact the Student Health Insurance Team\nwhen your university status has been updated to reflect one of the above statuses (or when you wish to remove a dependent or have been approved for Medicaid). You may be eligible to receive a\npro-rated refund of the remaining months' premiums on the student insurance plans in your student account (with adjustment for PhD support, if applicable)\n.\nThe final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31, for an April 1 cancellation. May, June and July cancellations are not permitted.\nDivision of Student Affairs\nAthletics, Physical Education & Recreation\nCareer & Professional Development Center\nCenter for Student Diversity & Inclusion\nCivility Initiatives\nCohon University Center\nCommunity Health & Well-Being\nCommunity Responsibility\nConference & Event Services\nCounseling & Psychological Services\nDean of Students\nDining Services\nFamily Engagement\nFirst-Year Orientation\nFraternity & Sorority Life\nHousing Services\nPre-College Programs\nResidential Education\nStudent Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\nStudent Support Resources\nUniversity Health Services\nWellness & Meaning-Making Programs\nUHS Partners\nAccreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\nDisability Resources\nTitle IX Initiatives\nUniversity Police\nUniversity Policies\nUniversity Health Services\nStudent Affairs\n100 Tech Street, 3rd Floor\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n412-268-2157\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n©\n2025\nCarnegie Mellon University\nCMU on Facebook\nCMU on Instagram\nHealthConnect\nNew Students\nFamily & Parents\nStudent Insurance\nEnroll in the SHIP\nWaive the SHIP\nChange or Cancel the SHIP\nSHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\nSHIP Rates & Billing\nUsing the SHIP\nInternational, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\nInsurance Literacy\nContacts & Common Questions\nLeaving CMU\nServices & Fees\nCOVID19\nSexual Assault Resources\nLGBTQIA+ Health\nSexual Health\nAllergy Injections\nHealth Education & Resources\nCulturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\nLocal Healthcare Resources\nPeer Health Advocates\nInformation for PHAs\nRecovery and Harm Reduction\nWellness To Go Machines\nAbout Us\nUHS News\nWho We Are\nLeaving CMU",
