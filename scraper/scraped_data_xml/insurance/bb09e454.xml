    <paragraphs>
      <paragraph>All full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. must have medical insurance that meets university requirements, either through enrolling in the CMU Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) or obtaining a SHIP waiver. Certain programs also require this of their part-time students. Students must take this action during their Open Enrollment period, through the insurance portal in Student Information Online (SIO).</paragraph>
      <paragraph>When deciding whether to enroll in the SHIP, or submit a SHIP waiver, it is important to review all the benefits and guidelines. And there are some important distinctions for international, exchange, and study abroad students:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Fall Term Study Abroad</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Students who study abroad are required to either enroll in the SHIP or apply to waive it, during the Fall Open Enrollment period.  Students who take no action during this time will be auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Spring Term Study Abroad</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Students going abroad for the Spring term will have already met the insurance requirement during the Fall Open Enrollment period and either have a SHIP enrollment or an approved waiver. There is no action required.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Information on immunization requirements and health forms can be found on the UHS website. For questions about immunizations and health forms, email Health Services.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>When deciding whether to enroll in the SHIP, or apply to waive it, it is helpful to first review SHIP benefits for the medical, dental and vision plans. It is also important to consider the following:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>All medical insurance plans must meet university waiver requirements. It is important to carefully review these requirements against your current plan, as most insurance plans from outside the U.S. will not meet our waiver requirements. Travel insurance plans do not meet university waiver requirements. Most travel plans only provide medical coverage for emergencies and do not provide coverage for routine exams (such as a check-up), pre-existing conditions, or mental health.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The only exception to this rule is for domestic students studying abroad during the the Fall term.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you are unsure whether your plan meets CMU requirements, you can request a plan review through the Student Health Insurance Office. Be sure to make the request prior to purchasing the plan.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>All insurance plans must be effective the first of the month you arrive on campus, and remain active for the duration of your time as an enrolled student. Please do not wait until you arrive in the U.S. to secure your insurance plan, or the effective date could be too late, and your waiver will be denied. Start looking into plans as soon as possible to ensure the plan will start when needed:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you arrive either before or after these dates, contact the CMU Student Health Insurance Office for assistance.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>International students must have a U.S. address to enroll in the SHIP. This address is where you will receive your insurance member ID card and other insurance documents, so it is important that you can receive mail there. If you do not have a U.S. address prior to your arrival, please wait until you have arrived to enroll:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>For any questions about SHIP enrollments and reimbursements, please contact the Student Health Insurance Office.</paragraph>

        <item>Students who wish to waive the SHIP only need to provide proof of active insurance. The insurance plan does not need to meet all university requirements for a waiver. However, if you are returning to CMU for the Spring term, your plan will need to meet waiver requirements at that time:

If your approved waiver already meets university requirements you do not need to take any additional action. Your waiver coverage period will be August 1 - July 31.
If your approved waiver does not meet university requirements (or if your insurance changed), you must either submit a new waiver application, or enroll in the SHIP during the Spring Open Enrollment period.
