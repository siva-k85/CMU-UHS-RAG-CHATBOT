Auto-enrollments also incur a $50 processing fee.\nQuestions about charges on your student account, invoices or payments should be directed to\nStudent Financial Services\n.\nMonthly Payment Option\nCMU offers a\nmonthly payment option\nthat allows you to pay your insurance premium in nine monthly payments (September - May).\nMedical Billing\nUnderstanding and tracking medical bills can be complicated.  To start, it is helpful to review the SHIP's\nMedical Plan Coverage Table\n, as well as some\ncommon insurance terms\n, in order to better understand what services are covered under the plan.  It is also important to register with\nHighmark\nwhere you can track your medical claims and access your\nExplanations of Benefits\n(EOB). The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.\nIf you are enrolled in the SHIP and receive care at University Health Services (UHS), many of the\nfees for our services\nwill be covered by the plan.  If you do owe a visit fee, that charge will be posted to your student account.\nIf you are enrolled in the SHIP and\nyou see a provider or have a hospital visit outside of UHS, you may\nreceive a bill\nfor non-covered services, and/or copays.\nIf you have outside insurance and receive care at UHS, you will need to submit an itemized statement (available in\nHealthConnect\n) to your insurance company for reimbursement. Please c\nall the member services phone number on the back of your insurance card for further instructions on how to submit your claim.\nLaboratory Testing\nBasic diagnostic testing is covered by the SHIP at in-network labs, but students will owe a $25 copay for the date of service.\nIf a test is not fully covered by the SHIP, students will recieve a bill from the laboratory for that amount.\nBills are sent to the address listed on your SHIP enrollment.\nStudents can find information on lab claims by accessing the\nExplanations of Benefits\n(EOB) in their Highmark portal. The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.\nBloodwork done at UHS is sent to Quest Diagnostics for processing:\nto track claims, pay a bill, or for any questions regarding bills register with\nQuest Diagnostics\nand/or call Quest Member Services.\nIf you have received a bill, or would like more detailed information on\nmedical billing (\nincluding ambulance charges), please visit the\nCommon Questions\npage.\nHow to Submit a Claim to the SHIP for Reimbursement\nClaim forms can be found in the\nHighmark forms library\n. Select the Tips\nicon for instructions on how to file each claim. Once filed, you can track your claims on your Highmark portal.\nFor more details, please visit the\nCommon Questions\npage.\nPrescription Costs\nIf you have the SHIP, prescription drugs are covered, with a\ncopay\n,\nat in-network pharmacies. However, p\nrescription drug costs vary according to the drug type (generic, brand-name and specialty), and their corresponding tier levels (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.). Lower tiers (generic) usually have lower copays, while higher tiers (brand-name and specialty) have higher copays.\nReview how to\nsearch for covered medications\nand corresponding copays.\nIf prescribed a higher tiered medication, speak to your provider, or pharmacist, about the possiblity of receiveing the less costly generic version, if available.\nSome medications can be filled at UHS when you see a UHS provider.\nMedications at UHS will incur up to a $15 copay per medication.\nOver-the-counter medicine and supplies (not prescribed) are not covered by the SHIP when purchased at a retail store (example: CVS or Rite Aid).\nDivision of Student Affairs\nAthletics, Physical Education & Recreation\nCareer & Professional Development Center\nCenter for Student Diversity & Inclusion\nCivility Initiatives\nCohon University Center\nCommunity Health & Well-Being\nCommunity Responsibility\nConference & Event Services\nCounseling & Psychological Services\nDean of Students\nDining Services\nFamily Engagement\nFirst-Year Orientation\nFraternity & Sorority Life\nHousing Services\nPre-College Programs\nResidential Education\nStudent Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\nStudent Support Resources\nUniversity Health Services\nWellness & Meaning-Making Programs\nUHS Partners\nAccreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\nDisability Resources\nTitle IX Initiatives\nUniversity Police\nUniversity Policies\nUniversity Health Services\nStudent Affairs\n100 Tech Street, 3rd Floor\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n412-268-2157\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n©\n2025\nCarnegie Mellon University\nCMU on Facebook\nCMU on Instagram\nHealthConnect\nNew Students\nFamily & Parents\nStudent Insurance\nEnroll in the SHIP\nWaive the SHIP\nChange or Cancel the SHIP\nSHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\nSHIP Rates & Billing\nUsing the SHIP\nInternational, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\nInsurance Literacy\nContacts & Common Questions\nLeaving CMU\nServices & Fees\nCOVID19\nSexual Assault Resources\nLGBTQIA+ Health\nSexual Health\nAllergy Injections\nHealth Education & Resources\nCulturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\nLocal Healthcare Resources\nPeer Health Advocates\nInformation for PHAs\nRecovery and Harm Reduction\nWellness To Go Machines\nAbout Us\nUHS News\nWho We Are\nLeaving CMU",
