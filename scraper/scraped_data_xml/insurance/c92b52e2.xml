      <paragraph>Health Services is here to provide quality care during your time as a CMU undergraduate or graduate student.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>As a new student, there are several health requirements you must fulfill prior to the start of classes. Please review the following details regarding health records, health insurance, and online courses.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>All new students to the Pittsburgh &amp; Silicon Valley campuses must submit required health forms and immunization information, including uploading a CMU Immunization Record Form signed by their healthcare provider before arriving on campus.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Students should log into HealthConnect and select Medical Clearances to review and submit all required health information. New fall students can access HealthConnect after commencement, in mid-May.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Failure to comply with the below requirements will result in administrative suspension and removal from university housing.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>New students must enter all immunization doses and dates, and upload the CMU Immunization Record Form (signed by a health care provider) in HealthConnect</paragraph>
      <paragraph>New fall semester students must submit immunization information by August 1.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>New spring semester students must submit immunization information by December 1.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR)</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Varicella (Chickenpox)</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Meningococcal AYWC (applies to students living in university housing)</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Tuberculosis (TB) Screening Form</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The following nearby pharmacies offer Varicella, Meningitis, and MMR vaccines on a walk-in basis and are in-network for CMU SHIP (so the vaccines are fully covered for students with CMU SHIP):</paragraph>
      <paragraph>CVS MinuteClinic</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Giant Eagle Market District Pharmacy</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Giant Eagle Pharmacy</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Allegheny County Health Department Immunization Clinic is another local option for vaccines.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>After commencement, new students can access all of our online forms and upload records in HealthConnect, under Medical Clearances in the left menu.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Please note: in order to access HealthConnect, your birthdate in the Student Information System (SIO) must be correct. If you are unable to access HealthConnect, check your birthdate in SIO. If it is incorrect, correct it at the HUB. The following day, it should be updated in HealthConnect. If you still have problems, email us for help.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Yes, if vaccination is not advised for medical reasons or conflicts with your religious belief/strong moral or ethical conviction. You can find and submit a vaccine exemption form in HealthConnect, under Downloadable Forms, or find them below:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Application for Personal or Religious Belief Exemption</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Application for Medical Exemption</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If a contagious disease outbreak occurs, the University reserves the right to ask students who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until the outbreak is over.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>All full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. must have medical insurance that meets university requirements; certain programs also require this of their part-time students. Students must fullfil CMU's insurance mandate during their Open Enrollment period.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Prior to a student's Open Enrollment period, a placeholder fee for the CMU Medical SHIP is posted on their student account. This charge is credited back for students who apply for and receive an approved waiver during open enrollment.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The CMU Student Health Insurance Medical Plan (CMU SHIP) is available to CMU undergraduate and graduate students, and their eligible dependents, during their Open Enrollment period. Optional vision and dental plans are also available.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Students must enroll in CMU SHIP or apply for a waiver each academic year, during their Open Enrollment period. Students who do not take action to either enroll or waive will be auto-enrolled in the medical CMU SHIP.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Addtional questions?  Review our Common Questions page.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If You Enroll in the CMU SHIP</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The insurance premium fees will remain on your student account. If you enroll in the vision or dental plans, or add dependents, the additional charges will be posted to your account once the enrollments have been processed.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If You Apply for a Waiver</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If your current insurance meets university requirements you may apply for a SHIP waiver. If approved, the student insurance charge will be credited back to the your student account.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If You Take No Action (not recommended)</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you do not enroll in SHIP, or apply for a waiver, during your Open Enrollment period, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU Medical SHIP, and the insurance premium fee will remain on your student account. And starting in Fall 25, auto-enrollments will also incur a $50 processing fee.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Waiting for this default-enrollment will delay access to your insurance details, so it is not recommended. If you intend to enroll in the student health insurance plan, please complete the steps to enroll during your Open Enrollment period.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Health and safety are critically important to the student experience, both in and out of the classroom. All new undergraduate students must complete online courses about substance use safety and sexual violence prevention. Incoming undergraduate students will receive access on Canvas on July 15th to two courses: Safer Scotties- Navigating Substance Use and Safer Scotties- Healthy Relationships. Incoming students should complete these courses by August 16th.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Having issues with the course? Questions? contact healthpromotion@andrew.cmu.edu</paragraph>
      <paragraph>HealthConnect is our secure online portal, where students can complete health history and immunizations forms, schedule certain appointments, order prescription refills, request medical records and more.</paragraph>
