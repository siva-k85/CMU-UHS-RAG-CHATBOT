If the hours do not work for your schedule, we can offer a list of community providers.\nSchedule an appointment\nHealth Services can administer up to a maximum of three injections. If you require more, we can offer a list of community providers.\nDownload the allergy information request letter and form.\nThis form is required to initiate allergy injections at UHS.\nRequirements for the extracts:\nYour full name must appear on the vial(s).\nPatient vial labels must be typewritten and contain an expiration\nHandwritten labels and “cross outs” are not acceptable.\nInjection records must be legible and contain unequivocal dosing instructions. These instructions must include directions for increasing patients through to their maintenance dose (interval and dose amount) and instructions for dose reductions if the patient is “late” for their injection or provided new vials\nThe strength, contents and expiration date of the allergen extracts must be on the vial and on the injection record.\nAll extracts vials received by UHS must be cool-to-touch. If we receive room temperature vials, UHS will contact your allergist to see if the vials are acceptable.\nExtracts will be kept in the refrigerator, unless otherwise indicated, in a compartment marked with your name. UHS is not responsible for replacing serum lost as a result of power outages.\nAt your first visit, you must have a physical exam by a clinician and meet with a nurse to review the allergy treatment schedule. Any unclear or missing information must be obtained from the allergist. You are required to have an annual visit with a clinician at UHS to continue receiving allergy injections here.\nDuring Vists to the UHS Allergy Clinic\nPlease check in at a kiosk in the waiting room. You should not receive an allergy injection(s) if you:\nHave a fever or extended illness for any reason\nAre wheezing, are short of breath, are having an exacerbation of asthma symptoms\nAre taking a Beta-Blocker or a drug containing a Beta Blocker, a drug used to treat irregular heartbeats, headaches, eye problems and high blood pressure\nIf your allergist requires you to pre-medicate before your injection and you have not done so, you will need to reschedule your appointment for the allergy injection.\nAfter receiving injections, you must wait 30 minutes* and have the injection site checked by the nurse for any reactions before leaving the clinic.\nDue to the importance of this safety policy, if you fail or decline to follow this policy, we can no longer provide your injections.\nWhile waiting to have the injection site checked, notify the nurse if you experience any of the following after receiving your injection(s):\nrunny nose, wheezing, sneezing, flushing, hives, coughing, itching, facial swelling, anxiety, or shortness of breath.\n*Based on best practice guidelines, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology\nAfter Receiving Your Injection\nYou must wait 30 minutes and have the injection site checked by the nurse for any reactions before leaving the clinic.\nAvoid rubbing or scratching the arm in which you received the injection.\nAvoid vigorous exercise 2 hours before and after injections, such as jogging, vigorous walking, gym workouts.\nAlthough you may not experience any local reaction within the 30 minutes after the injection, it is possible to react later in the day. If a local reaction occurs:\nTake an antihistamine (like Claritin, Zyrtec, Allegra, Benadryl)\nRecord the time and size of the reaction and how long it lasts. Report this to the nurse before you receiving the next injection.\nIf the symptoms worsen, return to UHS or go to the nearest emergency department\nYou will be asked to sign a document acknowledging that you have read and understand the information prior to receiving your first injection in the clinic.\nDivision of Student Affairs\nAthletics, Physical Education & Recreation\nCareer & Professional Development Center\nCenter for Student Diversity & Inclusion\nCivility Initiatives\nCohon University Center\nCommunity Health & Well-Being\nCommunity Responsibility\nConference & Event Services\nCounseling & Psychological Services\nDean of Students\nDining Services\nFamily Engagement\nFirst-Year Orientation\nFraternity & Sorority Life\nHousing Services\nPre-College Programs\nResidential Education\nStudent Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\nStudent Support Resources\nUniversity Health Services\nWellness & Meaning-Making Programs\nUHS Partners\nAccreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\nDisability Resources\nTitle IX Initiatives\nUniversity Police\nUniversity Policies\nUniversity Health Services\nStudent Affairs\n100 Tech Street, 3rd Floor\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n412-268-2157\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n©\n2025\nCarnegie Mellon University\nCMU on Facebook\nCMU on Instagram\nHealthConnect\nNew Students\nFamily & Parents\nStudent Insurance\nEnroll in the SHIP\nWaive the SHIP\nChange or Cancel the SHIP\nSHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\nSHIP Rates & Billing\nUsing the SHIP\nInternational, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\nInsurance Literacy\nContacts & Common Questions\nLeaving CMU\nServices & Fees\nCOVID19\nSexual Assault Resources\nLGBTQIA+ Health\nSexual Health\nAllergy Injections\nHealth Education & Resources\nCulturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\nLocal Healthcare Resources\nPeer Health Advocates\nInformation for PHAs\nRecovery and Harm Reduction\nWellness To Go Machines\nAbout Us\nUHS News\nWho We Are\nLeaving CMU",
