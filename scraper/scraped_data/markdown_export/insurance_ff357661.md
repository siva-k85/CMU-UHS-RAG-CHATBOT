SHIP Fees & Student Accounts
During
Open Enrollment
, a placeholder charge for the CMU SHIP is
posted on your student account.
The placeholder charge will appear in your student account as
Health Insurance - Student Only
. However, during Open Enrollment, this does not indicate a
SHIP enrollment
.
Once you complete Open Enrollment, the charge will be credited back to your account if you receive an approved waiver or will remain in your account if you enroll in the SHIP.
Students who do not complete Open Enrollment will be
auto-enrolled
and charged for an individual medical SHIP enrollment. Auto-enrollments also incur a $50 processing fee.
Questions about charges on your student account, invoices or payments should be directed to
Student Financial Services
.
Monthly Payment Option
CMU offers a
monthly payment option
that allows you to pay your insurance premium in nine monthly payments (September - May).
