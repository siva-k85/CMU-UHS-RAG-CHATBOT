      <paragraph>We are pleased to have the opportunity to serve you. CaPS is a voluntary, confidential counseling support for currently enrolled students.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>CaPS offers distance counseling via face-to-face video conferencing to currently enrolled CaPS students who meet the eligibility criteria for distance counseling services. Due to licensing laws, CaPS counselors may only provide ongoing therapy to those who are currently in the state of PA. Additionally, this service is available to clients assessed as being appropriate for this form of counseling. If a student is not eligible for this form of counseling, CaPS counselors will provide support and referrals to appropriate services.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>In order to set up services with CaPS, please call 412-268-2922 to schedule an initial consultation appointment. You will choose a password for all future sessions, and will enter this into Zoom Healthcare to enter the meeting. This process protects you from another person posing as you. You will be provided an email confirming your appointment with directions to review and sign the informed consent for telehealth services. The initial consultation will be virtual via Zoom and will be an opportunity for a clinician to get a good understanding of your needs and connect you with the most appropriate supports. This may be telehealth therapy or a more appropriate service. If telehealth therapy at CaPS is identified, you will be connected with an appropriate CaPS therapist.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>It is important to note that video communication may lack some visual or audio cues that on occasion may result in misunderstanding. This can be limited to a degree by using a stationary device such as a laptop or large tablet and remaining in the same room for your sessions. Should misunderstandings happen, it is important to assume that your counselor has positive regard for you, and to check out your assumptions with your counselor. This will reduce any unnecessary feelings of discomfort.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Video conferencing counseling sessions are held via Zoom Healthcare, a secure and confidential video conferencing platform. You will sign in with your Zoom app, but the therapist’s Zoom makes it more secure and confidential. It is recommended that you sign on to your account at least 5 minutes prior to your session start time. You are responsible for initiating the connection with CaPS via the provided software link and your identified password at the time of your session.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Distance counseling should not be viewed as a substitute for face-to-face counseling or medication by a physician. It is an alternative form of counseling with some differences from traditional counseling. For example:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>So that CaPS is able to get you help in the case of an emergency and for your safety, the following measures are important and necessary:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>CaPS provides services for all eligible students, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or veteran status. If it is determined by the clinical staff that an individual’s needs exceed the scope of service or expertise available at CaPS or that your needs cannot be adequately met by participating in distance counseling, we will assist you to identify an appropriate referral to meet your needs. CaPS does not pay the costs of therapy or community resources/treatment services to which you may be referred.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Confidentiality is essential to your counseling progress. Our counselors are therapists who are ethically and legally bound to maintain your confidentiality. A written and/or electronic record (date, time, nature of meeting) of your contacts with CaPS will be maintained in a secure manner.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Video conferencing sessions in our office are provided behind a closed door. All video conferencing correspondences will be done through Zoom Healthcare, which is encrypted to the federal standard.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>To schedule a pre-screening consultation appointment or for questions give us a call at 412-268-2922. For more information about our services and for additional resources https://www.cmu.edu/counseling/</paragraph>
      <paragraph>CaPS recommends that you (the client) are aware of and use safety measures for keeping your PHI (Personal Health Information) confidential, including but not limited to the following suggestions.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Paper</paragraph>
      <paragraph>It is recommended that you store all paper documents with your PHI in a locked cabinet.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>When participating in distance counseling it is also recommended that you:</paragraph>
