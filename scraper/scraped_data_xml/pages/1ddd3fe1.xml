Emergency
Contraception
Emergency contraception (EC) should be
taken after unprotected vaginal sex to
reduce the risk of pregnancy when birth
control was not used or a condom broke.
May use up to 72 hours after unprotected
sex
Effectiveness decreases the longer you
wait
Effectiveness decreases if over 165 lbs
Call UHS 412-268-2157, Option 2 for

covered by the student health insurance
plan and available at UHS!
