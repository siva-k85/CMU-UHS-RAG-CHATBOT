Cold, Flu or Covid?
As the new semester kicks into gear students will be in closer quarters and we may see an increase in transmissible illnesses like the cold, flu, and COVID-19, but these symptoms may be difficult to distinguish. UHS offers guidance on what to look for and how to treat your symptoms.
Call UHS for the following:
Severe symptoms (fever greater than 103 fahrenheit, severe cough, or shortness of breath)
Chronic conditions or if you are immunocompromised
Symptoms for more than 7 days
What to do
If you have mild cold and flu symptoms (see below) we recommend that you treat your symptoms with over the counter medications and stay home and isolate until you have no fever for 24 hours. The best way to prevent spread of upper respiratory viruses is to avoid unnecessary exposure and wear a high quality mask around others.
If you are concerned about COVID-19 and have mild symptoms rapid antigen tests are available over the counter. If you want to be tested for COVID-19 at the Health Center please call 412-268-2157 option 2 to schedule.
If you are negative for COVID, it is possible you have the flu or a cold.
If you are positive for COVID, please see
this page
or the
CDC
for further guidance.
You do not have to be seen by a medical provider for the flu, cold, or COVID-19 unless you are severely ill or short of breath.
Please wear a facial covering around others until you are symptom free.
Wash your hands often to keep from spreading germs to others.
Drink lots of fluids and take acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed for pain and/or fever.
Feel free to call UHS nurses to ask for advice (412-268-2157, option 2).

services and fees page.
Vaccines
The flu vaccine is available to students at UHS and covered by the student health insurance plan (SHIP). See our
services and fees page
for cost without SHIP. If you do not have the SHIP, check with your insurance company to see if the vaccine is covered.
Vaccination appointments can be scheduled online via
HealthConnect
, appointments available daily.
Learn more about the flu on the CDC website.
