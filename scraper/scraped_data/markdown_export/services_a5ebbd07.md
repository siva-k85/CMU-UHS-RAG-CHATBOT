Measles cases on the rise
Measles cases have been popping up in many parts of the country, including Pennsylvania. According to the
Center for Disease Control and Prevention
, measles is a highly contagious disease that can cause serious health complications. University Health Services (UHS) strongly recommends that all students are vaccinated.
The vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) is highly effective and much safer than the diseases it protects against. Being vaccinated not only protects you but helps to increase protection for our entire community. Check your immunization record in
HealthConnect
to see if you have already received the MMR vaccine. If not, you can schedule a vaccination appointment at UHS via
HealthConnect
or go to a local pharmacy.
