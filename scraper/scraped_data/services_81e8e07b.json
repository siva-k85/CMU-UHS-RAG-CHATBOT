  "content": "August 08, 2023\nCold, Flu or Covid?\nAs the new semester kicks into gear students will be in closer quarters and we may see an increase in transmissible illnesses like the cold, flu, and COVID-19, but these symptoms may be difficult to distinguish. UHS offers guidance on what to look for and how to treat your symptoms.\nCall UHS for the following:\nSevere symptoms (fever greater than 103 fahrenheit, severe cough, or shortness of breath)\nChronic conditions or if you are immunocompromised\nSymptoms for more than 7 days\nWhat to do\nIf you have mild cold and flu symptoms (see below) we recommend that you treat your symptoms with over the counter medications and stay home and isolate until you have no fever for 24 hours. The best way to prevent spread of upper respiratory viruses is to avoid unnecessary exposure and wear a high quality mask around others.\nIf you are concerned about COVID-19 and have mild symptoms rapid antigen tests are available over the counter. If you want to be tested for COVID-19 at the Health Center please call 412-268-2157 option 2 to schedule.\nIf you are negative for COVID, it is possible you have the flu or a cold.\nIf you are positive for COVID, please see\nthis page\nor the\nCDC\nfor further guidance.\nYou do not have to be seen by a medical provider for the flu, cold, or COVID-19 unless you are severely ill or short of breath.\nPlease wear a facial covering around others until you are symptom free.\nWash your hands often to keep from spreading germs to others.\nDrink lots of fluids and take acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed for pain and/or fever.\nFeel free to call UHS nurses to ask for advice (412-268-2157, option 2).\nFor more information about COVID19 care at UHS visit our\nservices and fees page.\nVaccines\nThe flu vaccine is available to students at UHS and covered by the student health insurance plan (SHIP). See our\nservices and fees page\nfor cost without SHIP. If you do not have the SHIP, check with your insurance company to see if the vaccine is covered.\nVaccination appointments can be scheduled online via\nHealthConnect\n, appointments available daily.\nLearn more about the flu on the CDC website.\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFLUENZA (FLU) AND COVID-19?\nCompare symptoms between the cold, FLU and COVID",
