Student Health Insurance Plan
Health Care Certificate
for groups utilizing an approved specified network
of providers, without a gatekeeper identified as
PPO Blue
effective as of
August 01, 2024
by and between
Carnegie Mellon University Student Plan
(Called the Group)
and
Highmark Inc., d/b/a
Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield*
(Called the Plan)
A Pennsylvania non-profit corporation whose mailing address is:
Fifth Avenue Place, 120 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222-3099.
GUARANTEED RENEWABLE
DESCRIPTION OF COVERAGE: This program sets forth a comprehensive program of inpatient and outpatient
benefits, most of which are provided at both network and out-of-network levels of benefits. Cost-sharing
options are available such as deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, and annual and lifetime maximums.
Benefits for certain services are only available if received from a network provider. Benefits are subject to the
Health Care Management Services Section with possible loss of benefits for non-compliance. Network services
are limited to the Keystone Health Plan West Network, the PremierBlue Shield Preferred Professional Provider
Network, the Highmark Blue Shield Participating Facility Provider Network and/or the Local PPO Network.
Network services are usually provided at a higher level of benefits than out-of-network services. Benefits for
pediatric dental services are only available through the United Concordia Advantage Provider Network and
benefits for vision care services are only available through the Davis Vision Network. A gatekeeper is not
necessary to access benefits from providers. This Contract is non-participating in any divisible surplus of
premium. The coverage provided under this Contract has an actuarial value of 91.36% which provides a
Platinum level of coverage.
(NOTE: All networks described within this Contract have been approved by the Pennsylvania Department of
Health, except for the network described as the Local PPO Network. The Plan reserves the right to use other
networks approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Health in the future, after notice to the Pennsylvania
Insurance Department.)

Benefits to which You are Entitled
Highmark's benefit liability is limited to the benefits specified in this Health Care Certificate. Except as provided
in the Transplant Services description, no person other than a member is entitled to receive benefits under this
Health Care Certificate. Such right to benefits and coverage is not transferable. Benefits for covered services
specified herein will be provided only for services and supplies rendered by providers as defined in this Health
Care Certificate.
Non-Assignment
Unless otherwise required by law, Highmark is authorized by the member to make payments directly to
providers furnishing Covered Services provided under the program described in this certificate; however,
Highmark reserves the right to make these payments directly to the member. The right of a member to receive
payment for a Covered Service described in this certificate is not assignable, except to the extent required by
law, nor may benefits described in this certificate be transferred either before or after Covered Services are
rendered. Any (direct or indirect) attempt to accomplish such an assignment shall be null and void. Nothing
contained in this certificate shall be construed to make Highmark, the group or the student health insurance
program sponsor liable to any assignee to whom a member may be liable for medical care, treatment, or
services.

Introduction to Your Health Care Program
*TTOCLVL1*Introduction to Your Health Care Program*TOCLVL1* his certificate provides you with the information you need to understand your health care program. We
encourage you to take the time to review this information, so you understand how your health care program
works.
Refer to the Summary of Benefits at the end of this certificate. The Summary of Benefits will tell you what you
need to know about your benefits, exclusions and how your plan works.
For a number of reasons, we think you'll be pleased with your health care program:
l Your health care program gives you freedom of choice. You are not required to select a primary care
provider to receive covered care. You have access to a large provider network of physicians, hospitals,
and other providers in Pennsylvania, as well as providers across the country who are part of the local
PPO network. For a higher level of coverage, you need to receive care from one of these network
providers. However, you can go outside the network and still receive care at the lower level of coverage.
To locate a network provider near you, or to learn whether your current physician is in the network, log
onto your Highmark member website, www.myhighmark.com.
l Your health care program gives you &quot;stay healthy&quot; care. You are covered for a range of preventive
care, including physical examinations and selected diagnostic tests. Preventive care is a proactive
approach to health management that can help you stay on top of your health status and prevent more
serious, costly care down the road.
You can review your Preventive Care Guidelines online at your member website. And, as a member of your
health care program, you get important extras. Along with 24-hour assistance with any health care question via
Blues On Call, your member website connects you to a range of self-service tools that can help you manage
your coverage. You can also access programs and services designed to help you make and maintain healthy
improvements. And you can access a wide range of care cost and care provider quality tools to assure you
spend your health care dollars wisely.
We understand that prescription drug coverage is of particular concern to our members. You'll find in-depth
information on these benefits in this certificate.
If you have any questions on your health care program, please call the Member Service toll-free telephone
number on the back of your ID card. For TTY/TDD hearing impaired service, please dial 711 and the number
on the back of your ID card.
Information for Non-English-Speaking Members
Non-English-speaking members have access to clear benefits information. They can call the toll-free Member
Service telephone number on the back of their ID card to be connected to a language services interpreter line.
Highmark Member Service representatives are trained to make the connection.
As always, we value you as a member, look forward to providing your coverage, and wish you good health.

How Your Benefits Are Applied
*TEMPLATE*CCBSPA_CERT_MEDICAL*TEMPLATE*

for which the charge is made. Refer to the Summary of Benefits for the benefit period under this program.
Medical and Prescription Drug Cost-Sharing Provisions
*CTOCLVL2*Medical and Prescription Drug Cost-Sharing Provisions*TOCLVL2* ost sharing is a requirement that you pay part of your expenses for covered services. The terms
&quot;copayment,&quot; &quot;deductible&quot; and &quot;coinsurance&quot; describe methods of such payment.
Coinsurance
The coinsurance is the specific percentage of the plan allowance for covered services that is your
responsibility. You may be required to pay any applicable coinsurance at the time you receive care from a
provider. Refer to the Summary of Benefits for the percentage amounts paid by the program.
Copayment
The copayment for certain covered services is the specific, upfront dollar amount which will be deducted from
the plan allowance and is your responsibility. See the Summary of Benefits for the copayment amounts.
Deductible
The deductible is a specified dollar amount you must pay for covered services e ach benefit period before the
program begins to provide payment for benefits. See the Summary of Benefits for the deductible amount. You
may be required to pay any applicable deductible at the time you receive care from a provider.

prescription drug will not apply toward the satisfaction of the deductible.
For more information regarding the Copay Armor program please call PillarRx toll free at (844) 438-8947.
Family Deductible
The family deductible is a specified dollar amount of covered services that must be incurred by covered family
members before the program begins to provide payment for benefits. See the Summary of Benefits for the
family deductible amount.
For a family with several covered dependents, the deductible you pay for all covered family members,
regardless of family size, is specified under family deductible. To reach this total, you can count the expenses
incurred by two or more covered family members. However, the deductible contributed towards the total by any
one covered family member will not be more than the amount of the individual deductible. If one family member
meets the individual deductible and needs to use benefits, the program would begin to pay for that person's
covered services even if the deductible for the entire family has not been met.

amount of deductible, coinsurance and copayments incurred for network covered services, covered
medications and any qualified medical expenses in a benefit period. When the specified individual dollar

members, your program begins to pay 100% of all covered expenses and no additional coinsurance,
copayments and deductible will be incurred for network covered services and covered medications in that
benefit period. See the Summary of Benefits for the total maximum out-of-pocket. The total maximum

How Your Health Care Program Works
*TEMPLATE*CCBSPA_CERT_MEDICAL*TEMPLATE*
*YTOCLVL1*How Your Health Care Program Works*TOCLVL1* our program is responsive, flexible coverage that lets you get the medically necessary and appropriate care
you want from the health care provider you select.
Here is how your health care program works. When you or a covered family member needs certain medical
services, including:
l Primary care provider office visits
l Specialist office visits
l Physical, speech and occupational therapy
l Diagnostic services
l Inpatient and outpatient hospital services
l Home health or hospice care
Network Care
*NTOCLVL2*Network Care*TOCLVL2* etwork care is care you receive from providers in your program's network.
When you receive health care within the network, you enjoy maximum coverage and maximum convenience.
You present your ID card to the provider who submits your claim.
Out-of-Network Care
*OTOCLVL2*Out-of-Network Care*TOCLVL2* ut-of-network care is care you receive from providers who are not in your program's network.
Out-of-network providers are not in the program's network. When using out-of-network providers, you may still
have coverage for most eligible services, except you will share more financial and paperwork responsibilities.
In addition, you may be responsible for paying any differences between the program's payments and the
provider's actual charges. Finally, you may need to file your own claims and obtain precertification for inpatient
care. You should always check with the provider before getting care to understand at what level your care will
be covered.
Remember: If you want to enjoy maximum benefits coverage, you need to be sure you receive care
from a network provider. See the Summary of Benefits for your coverage details.
Even though a hospital may be in our network, not every doctor providing services in that hospital is in
the network. For example: If you are having surgery, make sure that all of your providers, including
surgeons, anesthesiologists and radiologists, are in the network.
Out-of-Area Care
*YTOCLVL2*Out-of-Area Care*TOCLVL2* our program also provides coverage for you and your eligible dependents when you receive care from
providers located outside of Pennsylvania. For specific details, see the Inter-Plan Arrangements section of this
certificate.
If you are traveling and an urgent injury or illness occurs, you should seek treatment from the nearest hospital,
emergency room or clinic: If the treatment results in an admission the provider must obtain precertification from
Highmark. However, it is important that you confirm Highmark's determination of medical necessity and
appropriateness. If precertification is not obtained and the admission is not considered to be medically
CERT-STU-2024
42

necessary and appropriate, you will be responsible for all costs associated with the stay. For specific details,
see the Health Care Management section of this certificate.
Provider Reimbursement and Member Liability
*HTOCLVL2*Provider Reimbursement and Member Liability*TOCLVL2* ighmark uses the Plan Allowance to calculate the benefit payable and the financial liability of the member for
Medically Necessary and Appropriate Services covered under this plan. Refer to the Terms You Should Know
section for the definition of Plan Allowance.
Highmark's payment is determined by first subtracting any deductible and/or copayment liability from the Plan
Allowance. The coinsurance percentage set forth in the Summary of Benefits is then applied to that amount.
This amount represents Highmark's payment. Any remaining coinsurance amount is the member's
responsibility. The member's total cost-sharing liability is the sum of the coinsurance plus any deductible
and/or copayment obligations.
When a member receives covered services from an out-of-network provider, in addition to the member's
cost-sharing liability described above, the member is responsible for the difference between Highmark's
payment and the provider's billed charge. If a member receives services which are not covered under this plan,
the member is responsible for all charges associated with those services.
However, the following covered services when received from an out-of-network provider will be provided at the
network services level of benefits and you will not be responsible for such difference:
1. Emergency care services; and
2. Ambulance services, when provided in conjunction with emergency care services or when provided by
air.
Additionally, in very limited circumstances, you may not be liable for charges for non-emergency covered
services received from certain professional providers or ancillary providers who are not part of the network.
When you are a patient at a network facilty provider, a professional provider or ancillary provider who is not
part of the network may render certain items and professional services (such as, but not limited to
consultations, equipment, devices, anesthesiology, radiology or pathology services) to you. The selection of
such professional providers or ancillary providers may be beyond your control. In that situation, you will not be
liable, except for applicable network deductible, copayment or coinsurance obligations, for the charges of the
professional provider or ancillary provider.
Inter-Plan Arrangements
*OTOCLVL2*Inter-Plan Arrangements*TOCLVL2* ut-of-Area Services
Highmark has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees referred to
generally as &quot;inter-plan arrangements.&quot; These inter-plan arrangements operate under rules and procedures
issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Whenever members access health care services outside of
Pennsylvania, the claim for those services may be processed through one of these inter-plan arrangements, as
described generally below.
Typically, when accessing care outside of Pennsylvania, members obtain care from providers that have a
contractual agreement (&quot;participating providers&quot;) with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that
other geographic area (&quot;Host Blue&quot;). In some instances, members may obtain care from providers in the Host
Blue geographic area that do not have a contractual agreement (&quot;non-participating providers&quot;) with the Host
Blue. Highmark remains responsible for fulfilling our contractual obligations to you. Highmark's payment
practices in both instances are described below.
CERT-STU-2024
43

BlueCard® Program
The BlueCard® Program is an inter-plan arrangement. Under this arrangement, when members access
covered services outside of Pennsylvania, the Host Blue will be responsible for contracting and handling all
interactions with its participating health care providers.
The financial terms of the BlueCard Program are described generally below.
Liability Calculation Method per Claim
Unless subject to a fixed dollar copayment, the calculation of the member liability on claims for covered
services processed through the BlueCard Program will be based on the lower of the participating provider's
billed charges for covered services or the negotiated price made available to Highmark by the Host Blue.
Host Blues determine a negotiated price, which is reflected in the terms of each Host Blue's health care
provider contracts. The negotiated price made available to Highmark by the Host Blue may be represented by
one of the following:
l an actual price - An actual price is a negotiated rate of payment in effect at the time a claim is processed
without any other increases or decreases, or
l an estimated price - An estimated price is a negotiated rate of payment in effect at the time a claim is
processed, reduced or increased by a percentage to take into account certain payments negotiated with
the provider and other claim- and non-claim-related transactions. Such transactions may include, but are
not limited to, anti-fraud and abuse recoveries, provider refunds not applied on a claim-specific basis,
retrospective settlements and performance-related bonuses or incentives, or
l an average price - An average price is a percentage of billed charges for covered services in effect at the
time a claim is processed representing the aggregate payments negotiated by the Host Blue with all of its
providers or a similar classification of its providers and other claim- and non-claim-related transactions.
Such transactions may include the same ones as noted above for an estimated price.
Host Blues determine whether or not they will use an actual price, estimated or average price. Host Blues
using either an estimated price or an average price may prospectively increase or reduce such prices to
correct for over- or underestimation of past prices, (i.e., prospective adjustment may mean that a current price
reflects additional amounts or credits for claims already paid or anticipated to be paid to providers or refunds
received or anticipated to be received from providers). However, the BlueCard Program requires that the
amount paid by the member is a final price; no future price adjustment will result in increases or decreases to
the pricing of past claims. The method of claims payment by Host Blues is taken into account by Highmark in
determining the member's premiums.
Special Cases: Value-Based Programs
Highmark has included a factor for bulk distributions from Host Blues in your premium for Value-Based
Programs when applicable under your program. Additional information is available upon request.
Return of Overpayments
Recoveries of overpayments from a Host Blue or its participating and non-participating providers can arise in
several ways, including, but not limited to, anti-fraud and abuse recoveries, provider/hospital bill audits, credit
balance audits, utilization review refunds and unsolicited refunds. Recoveries will be applied so that corrections
will be made, in general, on either a claim-by-claim or prospective basis. If recovery amounts are passed on a
claim-by-claim basis from a Host Blue to Highmark, they will be credited to your account. In some cases, the
Host Blue will engage a third party to assist in identification or collection of overpayments. The fees of such a
third party may be charged to you as a percentage of the recovery.
CERT-STU-2024
44

Inter-Plan Programs: Federal State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees
In some instances, federal or state laws or regulations may impose a surcharge, tax or other fee that applies to
insured accounts. If applicable, Highmark will include any such surcharge, tax or other fee in determining your
premium.
Non-Participating Providers Outside Pennsylvania
Member Liability Calculation
When covered services are provided outside Pennsylvania by non-participating providers, the amount(s) a
member pays for such services will generally be based on either the Host Blue's non-participating provider
local payment or the pricing arrangements required by applicable law. In these situations, the member may be
responsible for the difference between the amount that the non-participating provider bills and the payment
Highmark will make for the covered services as set forth in this paragraph. Payments for emergency services
rendered by non-participating providers will be governed by applicable federal and state law.
Exceptions
In some exception cases, Highmark may pay claims from non-participating providers outside Pennsylvania
based on the provider's billed charge. This may occur in situations where a Member did not have reasonable
access to the participating provider, as determined by Highmark in Highmark's sole and absolute discretion or
by applicable law. In other exception cases, Highmark may pay such claims based on the payment Highmark
would make if Highmark were paying a non-participating provider for the same covered service inside the Plan
Service Area as described elsewhere in this document. This may occur where the Host Blue's corresponding
payment would be more than the plan in-service area non-participating provider payment. Highmark may
choose to negotiate a payment with such a provider on an exception basis.
Unless otherwise stated, in any of these exception situations, the Member may be responsible for the
difference between the amount that the non-participating provider bills and payment Highmark will make for the
covered services as set forth in this paragraph.
Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program
If members are outside the United States (hereinafter &quot;BlueCard service area&quot;), they may be able to take
advantage of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program when accessing covered services. The Blue
Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program is unlike the BlueCard Program available in the BlueCard service area
in certain ways. For instance, although the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program assists members with
accessing a network of inpatient, outpatient and professional providers, the network is not served by a Host
Blue. As such, when members receive care from providers outside the BlueCard service area, they will
typically have to pay the providers and submit the claims themselves to obtain reimbursement for these
services.
Inpatient Services
In most cases, if members contact the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core service center (&quot;service center&quot;) for
assistance, hospitals will not require members to pay for inpatient covered services, except for their
cost-sharing amounts. In such cases, a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core contracting hospital will submit
member claims to the service center to initiate claims processing. However, if the member paid in full at the
time of service, the member must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement for covered services. Members
must contact Highmark to obtain precertification or preauthorization for non-emergency inpatient
services.
Outpatient Services
Physicians, urgent care centers and other outpatient providers located outside the BlueCard service area will
typically require members to pay in full at the time of service. Members must submit a claim to obtain
reimbursement for covered services.
CERT-STU-2024
45

Submitting a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Claim
When members pay for covered services outside the BlueCard service area, they must submit a claim to
obtain reimbursement. For institutional and professional claims, members should complete a Blue Cross Blue
Shield Global Core International claim form and send the claim form with the provider's itemized bill(s) to the
service center address on the form to initiate claims processing. The claim form is available from Highmark, the
service center or online at www.bcbsglobalcore.com. If members need assistance with their claim
submissions, they should call the service center at 800-810-BLUE (2583) or call collect at 804-673-1177, 24
hours a day, seven days a week.
Your Provider Network
*TTOCLVL2*Your Provider Network*TOCLVL2* he network includes: primary care providers; a wide range of specialists; mental health and substance abuse
providers; community and specialty hospitals; and laboratories.
To determine if your physician is in the network, call the Member Service toll-free telephone number on the
back of your ID card, or log onto www.myhighmark.com.
Getting your care &quot;through the network&quot; also assures you get quality care. All physicians are carefully
evaluated before they are accepted into the network. We consider educational background, office procedures
and performance history to determine eligibility. Then we monitor care on an ongoing basis through office
record reviews and patient satisfaction surveys.
Please note that while you or a family member can use the services, including behavioral health and
well-woman care, of any network physician or specialist without a referral and receive the maximum coverage
under your benefit program, you are encouraged to select a personal or primary care provider. This helps
establish an ongoing relationship based on knowledge and trust and helps make your care consistent. Your
personal provider can help you select an appropriate specialist and work closely with that specialist when the
need arises. In addition, primary care providers or their covering physicians are on call 24/7.
Remember:
It is your responsibility to ensure that you receive network care. You may want to double-check any
provider recommendations to make sure the doctor or facility is in the network.

Prescription Drug Providers
*YTOCLVL2*Prescription Drug Providers*TOCLVL2* ou must purchase drugs from a network pharmacy to be eligible for benefits under this program. No benefits
are available if drugs are purchased from a non-network pharmacy.
l Network Pharmacy: Network pharmacies have an arrangement with Highmark to provide
prescription drugs to you at an agreed upon price. When you purchase covered drugs from a
pharmacy in the network applicable to your program, present your prescription and ID card to the
pharmacist. (Prescriptions that the pharmacy receives by phone from your physician or dentist may
also be covered.) You should request and retain a receipt for any amounts you have paid if needed
for income tax or any other purpose.
If you travel within the United States and need to refill a prescription, call Member Service for help. They
can help you find a network pharmacy near the area you are visiting. You also can use the member
website to find a pharmacy. Once you have the name and address of the network pharmacy, take the
prescription bottle to that pharmacy. The pharmacist will contact your home pharmacy to start the refill
process. Note: Save the new medicine container. This will make it easier to transfer the
prescription back to your pharmacy at home.
l Mail Order Pharmacy: Express Scripts® is your program's mail order pharmacy. This option offers
savings and convenience for prescriptions you may take on an ongoing basis.
To start using mail order:
1. Ask your doctor to write a prescription for up to a 90-day supply, plus refills for up to one year, if
appropriate.
2. Complete the Pharmacy Mail Order Form and Health, Allergy &amp; Medication Questionnaire. You can
get these forms by calling Member Service or from your member website. After logging in, click on

*MTOCLVL1*Health Care Management*TOCLVL1* edical Management
*FTOCLVL2*Medical Management*TOCLVL2* or your benefits to be paid under your program, services and supplies must be considered medically
necessary and appropriate. However, not all medically necessary and appropriate services and supplies are
covered under your program.
Highmark, or its designated agent, is responsible for determining whether care is medically necessary and
provided in the appropriate setting.
A Highmark nurse will review your request for an inpatient admission to ensure it is appropriate for the
treatment of your condition, illness, disease or injury, in accordance with standards of good medical practice,
and the most appropriate supply or level of service that can safely be provided to you. When applied to
hospitalization, this further means that you require acute care as an inpatient due to the nature of the services
rendered for your condition and you cannot receive safe or adequate care as an outpatient.
Benefits after Provider Termination from the Network
*ITOCLVL2*Benefits after Provider Termination from the Network*TOCfLVL2*, at the time you are receiving medical care from a network provider, notice is received from Highmark that
Highmark intends to terminate or has terminated all or portions of the contract of that network provider for
reasons other than cause; or the contract of that network will not be renewed, or the participation status of the
network provider is changing, you may, at your option, continue an active course of treatment with that provider
until the treatment is complete or for a period of up to ninety (90) days from the date the notification of the
termination or pending termination is received, whichever is shorter. For purposes of this subsection, active
course of treatment means;
1. an ongoing course of treatment for a life-threatening condition, defined as a disease or condition for
which likelihood of death is probable unless the course of the disease or condition is interrupted;
2. an ongoing course of treatment for a serious acute condition, defined as a disease or condition
requiring specialized medical treatment to avoid the reasonable possibility of death or permanent
harm or complex ongoing care which you are currently receiving, such as chemotherapy, radiation
therapy or post-operative visits;
3. confirmed pregnancy, through the postpartum period;
4. scheduled non-elective surgery, through post-operative care;
5. an ongoing course of treatment for a health condition that is life-threatening, degenerative,
potentially disabling or congenital and that requires specialized medical care over a prolonged
period of time or for which a treating physician or health care provider attests that discontinuing
care by that physician or health care provider would worsen the condition or interfere with
anticipated outcomes; or
6. treatment for a terminal illness.
If, however, the network provider is terminated for cause and you continue to seek treatment from that
provider, Highmark will not be liable for payment for health care services provided to you following the date of
termination.
CERT-STU-2024
50

Any services authorized under this subsection will be covered in accordance with the same terms and
conditions as applicable to a network provider. Nothing in this subsection shall require Highmark to pay
benefits for health care services that are not otherwise provided herein.
Transition of Care
If you are receiving medical care from an out-of-network provider, which is not otherwise covered by prior
coverage, at the time when your coverage under this Certificate begins, you may opt to continue an ongoing
course of treatment with that provider for a period of up to sixty (60) days. However, if you are in the second or
third trimester of pregnancy when this coverage begins, the transition of care period shall extend through
postpartum care related to the delivery. You must notify Highmark as soon as possible of your request to
continue an ongoing course of treatment for the transition of care period by calling the Member Service toll-free
telephone number on the back of your ID card.
Emergency Care Services - No Prior Approval Requirement
In the event that you require emergency care services, all charges for such covered services will be paid at the
network services level of benefits. No prior authorization is required for emergency care services. In the event
of an inpatient admission, you, your provider or a family member must notify Highmark within forty-eight (48)
hours of the admission, or as soon as reasonably possible. Once you are stabilized Highmark may offer to
transfer your care from an out-of-network provider to a network provider.
Pre-Admission Certification
When you require inpatient facility care, benefits for covered services will be provided as follows:
In-Area Network Care
When you use a network facility provider for inpatient care for other than an emergency admission, the facility
will contact Highmark prior to the proposed admission, or within 48 hours or as soon as reasonably possible
after an emergency admission, to obtain precertification for the admission.
You will be held harmless whenever precertification for an admission is not obtained. If the admission is
determined not to be medically necessary and appropriate, you will be held harmless, except when Highmark
provides prior written notice to you that the admission will not be covered. In such case, you will be financially
responsible for charges for that admission.
Out-of-Area Network Care
In the event of a proposed inpatient stay for other than an emergency admission to a network facility provider
located out-of-area, the facility will contact Highmark prior to the proposed admission, or within 48 hours or as
soon as reasonably possible after an emergency admission, to obtain precertification for the admission. You
are also responsible for contacting Highmark at the toll-free number listed on the back of your ID card to
confirm Highmark's determination of medical necessity and appropriateness.
If precertification for a medically necessary and appropriate inpatient admission has been obtained, benefits for
covered services will be provided. If a network facility does not contact Highmark for precertification, the
inpatient admission will be reviewed for medical necessity and appropriateness. It is important that you
confirm Highmark's determination of medical necessity and appropriateness. If your admission is
determined not to be medically necessary and appropriate, you will be responsible for the full amount
of the network facility provider's charge.
If you elect to be admitted after receiving written notification from Highmark that any portion of the proposed
admission is not medically necessary and appropriate, you will be financially responsible for all charges
associated with that portion of care. In an emergency admission, if you elect to remain hospitalized after
receiving written notification from Highmark that the level of care is no longer medically necessary and
CERT-STU-2024
51

appropriate, you will be financially responsible for all charges from the date appearing on the written
notification.
Out-of-area network providers are not obligated to abide by any determination of medical necessity and
appropriateness rendered by Highmark. You may, therefore, receive services which are not medically
necessary and appropriate for which you will be solely responsible.
Out-of-Network Care
In the event of a proposed inpatient stay for other than an emergency admission to an out-of-network facility
provider, you are responsible for notifying Highmark prior to your proposed admission or within 48 hours or
as soon as reasonably possible after an emergency admission. However, some facility providers will contact
Highmark and obtain precertification of the inpatient admission on your behalf. Be sure to verify that your
provider is contacting Highmark for precertification. If not, you are responsible for contacting Highmark.
If precertification for a medically necessary and appropriate inpatient admission has been obtained, benefits for
covered services will be provided. If you do not contact Highmark for precertification as required, the inpatient
admission will be reviewed for medical necessity and appropriateness. If your admission is determined not
to be medically necessary and appropriate, you will be responsible for the full amount of the
out-of-network facility provider's charge.
If you elect to be admitted after receiving written notification from Highmark that any portion of the proposed
admission is not medically necessary and appropriate, you will be financially responsible for all charges
associated with that portion of care. In an emergency admission, if you elect to remain hospitalized after
receiving written notification from Highmark that the level of care is no longer medically necessary and
appropriate, you will be financially responsible for all charges from the date appearing on the written
notification.
Care Utilization Review Process
*ITOCLVL2*Care Utilization Review Process*TOCLVL2*n order to assess whether care is provided in the appropriate setting, Highmark administers a care utilization
review program comprised of prospective, concurrent and/or retrospective reviews. In addition, Highmark
assists hospitals with discharge planning. These activities are conducted by a Highmark nurse working with a
medical director. Here is a brief description of these review procedures:
Prospective Review
Prospective review, also known as precertification or pre-service review, begins upon receipt of treatment
information. Upon receipt and review of a precertification request from a provider, if Highmark determines that
information is missing that is needed in order to make a decision, Highmark will notify the requesting provider
that the information is missing. Highmark will identify the missing information with enough specificity so that the
provider can submit the information needed to Highmark.
After receiving the request for care, Highmark:
l verifies your eligibility for coverage and availability of benefits;
l reviews diagnosis and plan of treatment;
l assesses whether care is medically necessary and appropriate;
l makes a decision regarding the request, and if approved, authorizes care and assigns an
appropriate length of stay for inpatient admissions.
CERT-STU-2024
52

In making a decision regarding the precertification request, Highmark will consider medical policies,
administrative policies, your relevant medical information, and medical or scientific evidence submitted by your
provider.
Concurrent Review
Concurrent review may occur during the course of ongoing treatment and is used to assess the medical
necessity and appropriateness of the length of stay and level of care. At the time of the review, Highmark will
verify your eligibility for coverage and availability of benefits and assess whether the care is medically
necessary and appropriate. In making a decision, Highmark will consider its medical policies, administrative
policies, your relevant medical information, and medical or scientific evidence submitted by your provider.
Discharge Planning
Discharge planning is a process that begins prior to your scheduled hospital admission. Working with you, your
family, your attending physician(s) and hospital staff, Highmark will help plan for and coordinate your discharge
to assure that you receive safe and uninterrupted care when needed at the time of discharge.
Outpatient Procedure or Covered Service Precertification
Precertification may be required to determine the medical necessity and appropriateness of certain outpatient
procedures or covered services as determined by Highmark prior to the receipt of services.
In-Area Network Care
Network providers are responsible for the precertification of such procedure or covered service and you will not
be financially responsible whenever certification for such procedure or covered service is not obtained by the
network provider. If the procedure or covered service is deemed not to be medically necessary and
appropriate, you will not be financially responsible, except when Highmark provides prior written notice to you
that charges for the procedure or covered service will not be covered. In such case, you will be financially
responsible for such procedure or covered service.
Out-of-Area Care
Whenever you utilize a network provider located out-of-area, it is your responsibility to first contact Highmark to
confirm the medical necessity and appropriateness of such procedure or covered service. If you do not contact
Highmark for certification, that procedure or covered service may be reviewed after it is received to determine
medical necessity and appropriateness. If the procedure or covered service is determined to be medically
necessary and appropriate, benefits will be paid in accordance with the plan. If the procedure or covered
service is determined not to be medically necessary and appropriate, no benefits will be provided. In such case
you will be financially responsible for the full amount of the charge of the network provider located out-of-area.
Out-of-Network Care
Whenever you utilize an out-of-network provider, it is your responsibility to first contact Highmark to confirm the
medical necessity and appropriateness and/or obtain precertification of such procedure or covered service. If
you do not contact Highmark for precertification, that procedure or covered service may be reviewed after it is
received to determine medical necessity and appropriateness. If the procedure or covered service is
determined to be medically necessary and appropriate, benefits will be paid in accordance with the plan. You
will be financially responsible for the difference between what is covered by the plan and the full amount of the
out-of-network provider's charge. If such procedure or covered service is determined not to be medically
necessary and appropriate, no benefits will be provided. In such case, you will be financially responsible for the
full amount of the out-of-network provider's charge.
If you have any questions regarding procedures and services subject to precertification or Highmark's
precertification determination of a procedure or service for medical necessity and appropriateness of certain
CERT-STU-2024
53

outpatient procedures or covered services, you can contact Highmark via the toll-free Member Service
telephone number located on the back of your ID card or check the member website.
Retrospective Review
Retrospective review may occur when a service or procedure has been rendered without the required
precertification.
Case Management Services
Case Management is a voluntary program in which a case manager, with input from you and your health care
providers, assists when you are facing and/or recovering from a hospital admission, dealing with multiple
medical problems or facing catastrophic needs. Highmark case managers can provide educational support,
assist in coordinating needed health care services, put you in touch with community resources, assist in
addressing obstacles to your recovery such as benefit and caregiver issues and answer your questions.
Individual Case and Care Management
Highmark shall provide such alternative benefits, in its sole discretion, only when, and for so long as, it
determines that the services are medically necessary and appropriate, cost effective, and that the total benefits
paid for such procedures/services do not exceed the total benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled to.
Highmark, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit access and/or modify benefit(s), regardless of the
disease or condition, when Highmark identifies utilization patterns that could potentially result in harm to you or
the public.
You can call and request case management services if you feel you need it by contacting Member Services at
the telephone number listed on the back of your ID card.
Health Improvement Services and Support
From time to time, Highmark may directly or indirectly make available to you information and access to
non-medical items, services and support programs designed to address underlying social and environmental
factors that may negatively impact your health status. The provision of such information, items, services, and
support programs shall not alter the benefits provided under this program.
Selection of Providers
You have the option of choosing where and from whom to receive covered services. You may utilize a network
provider or an out-of-network provider. However, covered services received from a network provider are
usually provided at a higher level of benefits than those received from an out-of-network provider and certain
non-emergency services may only be covered when rendered by a network provider. Please note that benefits
for covered telemedicine services are only provided when such services are rendered by a designated
telemedicine provider.
In the event you require non-emergency covered services that are not available within the network, Highmark
may refer you to an out-of-network provider. You must notify Highmark prior to receiving a covered service
from an out-of-network provider in order for Highmark to facilitate this arrangement. In such cases, services will
be covered at the n etwork level so that you will not be responsible for any greater out-of-pocket amount than if
services had been rendered by a network provider. You will not be responsible for any difference between
Highmark's payment and the out-of-network provider's billed charge.

Prescription Drug Management
*YTOCLVL2*Prescription Drug Management*TOCLVL2* our prescription drug program provides the following provisions which will determine the medical necessity
and appropriateness of covered medications and supplies.
Early Refill
Except for the purposes of Medication Synchronization and refills of covered medications that are eyedrops, no
coverage is provided for any refill of a covered medication that is dispensed before your predicted use of at
least 75% of the days' supply of the previously dispensed covered medication, unless your physician obtains
precertification from Highmark for an earlier refill.
Coverage for refills of covered medications shall be provided for any refill dispensed between either:
l twenty-one (21) and thirty (30) days (for 30-day supply);
l forty-two (42) and sixty (60) days (for 60-day supply); or
l sixty-three (63) and ninety (90) days (for 90-day supply)
after the date on which the Member received the original prescription or the most recent refill.
Unexpected Event
If your prescription is lost or stolen due to an event such as a fire or theft, you may be able to get an early
refill. Call Member Service at the number on your member ID card for help. You will need a copy of the
report from the fire department, police department or other agency.
Please note: The early refill authorization does not apply to events that can be controlled, such as spilling
or losing the medicine.
Traveling Abroad
If you will be out of the country when it is time to refill your prescription, call Member Service for help. Be
sure to have your member ID card and your prescription information. Please allow at least five business
days to complete the request.
Individual Case Management
From time to time, Highmark may offer you the opportunity to participate in Prescription Drug care
management programs. These programs are designed to help you maintain good health, manage chronic
conditions or special health care needs and reduce risk factors. Such care management programs may include
the provision of devices or durable medical equipment at no additional cost to you. Participation in select
programs is voluntary and Highmark reserves the right to modify or discontinue any such program at any time.
Highmark, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit access and/or modify benefit(s), regardless of the
disease or condition, when Highmark identifies utilization patterns that could potentially result in harm to you or
the public.
Quantity Level Limits
Quantity level limits may be imposed on certain prescription drugs by Highmark. Such limits are based on the
manufacturer’s recommended daily dosage or as determined by Highmark. Quantity level limits control the
quantity covered each time a new prescription order or refill is dispensed for selected prescription drugs. Each
time a prescription order or refill is dispensed, the pharmacy provider may limit the amount dispensed.
Managed Prescription Drug Coverage
A prescription order or refill which may exceed the manufacturer’s recommended dosage over a specified
period of time may be denied by Highmark when presented to the pharmacy provider. Highmark may contact
CERT-STU-2024
55

the prescribing physician to determine if the covered medication is medically necessary and appropriate. The
covered medication will be dispensed if it is determined by Highmark to be medically necessary and
appropriate.
Preauthorization
Certain prescription drugs may require preauthorization to ensure the medical necessity and appropriateness
of the prescription order. The prescribing physician must obtain authorization from Highmark prior to
prescribing certain covered medications. The specific drugs or drug classifications which require
preauthorization may be obtained by calling the toll-free Member Service telephone number appearing on your
ID card.
Precertification, Preauthorization and Pre-Service Claims Review
Processes
*TTOCLVL2*Precertification, Preauthorization and Pre-Service Claims Review Processes*TOCLVL2*he precertification, preauthorization and pre-service claims review processes information described below

services require precertification, preauthorization or pre-service claims review, please call the toll-free Member
Service telephone number located on the back of your ID Card.
Authorized Representatives
You have a right to designate an authorized representative to file or pursue a request for precertification or
other pre-service claim on your behalf. Highmark reserves the right to establish reasonable procedures for
determining whether an individual has been authorized to act on your behalf. Procedures adopted by Highmark
will, in the case of an urgent care claim, permit a physician or other professional health care provider with
knowledge of your medical condition to act as your authorized representative.
Decisions Involving Requests for Precertification and Other Non-Urgent Care
Pre-Service Claims
You will receive written notice of any decision on a request for precertification or other pre-service claim,
whether the decision is adverse or not, within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the medical
circumstances involved. That period of time will not exceed 15 days from the date Highmark receives the claim
unless otherwise extended by Highmark for reasons beyond its control where permitted by law.
If Highmark determines that sufficient information was not provided for Highmark to make a decision, your
physician will be notified of additional facts or documents needed so that the review can be completed within
the time frame referenced above.
Closely Related Service
There may be circumstances where your provider may perform a closely related service for which
precertification was required but was not obtained. In that case, Highmark may not deny coverage of the
closely related service for failure to obtain precertification if your provider notifies Highmark of the
provided service no later than 3 business days following completion of the closely related service but
before submission of the claim for payment. Your provider’s notification to Highmark must include all
relevant clinical information necessary to evaluate the medical necessity and appropriateness of the
closely related service.
The Plan may perform a post-service review and determine that the closely related service was not
medically necessary and appropriate. The Plan may also verify the member’s eligibility for coverage at
the time of the post-service review.

l You are eligible for another group health care benefits program through your group.
l When your group's program is terminated and replaced by another health care benefits program.
Termination of Your Coverage Under the Group Insured Contract
*YTOCLVL2*Termination of Your Coverage Under the Group Insured Contract*TOCLVL2* our coverage can be terminated in the following instances:
l When you cease to be a student, the group shall promptly notify Highmark that you are no longer
eligible for coverage and that your coverage should be terminated as follows:
¡ When prompt notification is received, coverage will be terminated no earlier than the date on
which you cease to be eligible.
¡ When a group requests a retroactive termination of coverage, coverage will be terminated no
earlier than the first day of the month preceding the month in which Highmark received notice
from the group.
l When you fail to pay the required contribution, your coverage will terminate at the end of the last
month for which payment was made.
l Termination of the group insured contract automatically terminates the coverage of all the
members. It is the responsibility of the group to notify you of the termination of coverage. However,
coverage will be terminated regardless of whether the notice is given to you by the group.
l If it is proven that you obtained or attempted to obtain benefits or payment for benefits through fraud
or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact, Highmark may, upon 30-day advance written
notice to you, terminate your coverage under the program.

Benefits after Termination of Coverage
* l TOCLVL2*Benefits after Termination of Coverage*TOCLVL2* If you are an inpatient on the day your coverage terminates, benefits for inpatient covered services will be
continued as follows:
¡ Until the maximum amount of benefits has been paid; or
¡ Until the inpatient stay ends; or
¡ Until you become covered, without limitation as to the condition for which you are receiving
inpatient care, under another group program; whichever occurs first.
l If you are pregnant on the date coverage terminates, no additional coverage will be provided.
l If you are totally disabled at the time your coverage terminates due to termination of being an active
student, medical benefits, excluding outpatient prescription drug benefits, will be continued for covered
services directly related to the condition causing such total disability. This benefit extension does not
apply to covered services relating to other conditions, illnesses, diseases or injuries and is not available if
your termination was due to fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact. This total disability
extension of benefits will be provided as long as you remain so disabled as follows:
¡ Up to a maximum period of 12 consecutive months; or
¡ Until the maximum amount of benefits has been paid; or
¡ Until the total disability ends; or
¡ Until you become covered without limitation as to the disabling condition under other group
coverage, whichever occurs first.
l If you are required to pay any premium, your benefits will not be continued if your coverage is terminated
because you failed to pay the required premium.
l Benefits will also be provided for you who, on the date this coverage terminates and as described in the
Health Care Management, Benefits after Provider Termination from the Network subsection, is in an
active course of treatment until the earlier of such time as that treatment has been completed or for a
period of up to ninety (90) days from the date this coverage terminates.
Coordination of Benefits
*MTOCLVL2*Coordination of Benefits*TOCLVL2* ost health care programs, including your health care program, contain a coordination of benefits provision.
This provision is used when you, your spouse or your covered dependents are eligible for payment under more
than one health care program. The object of coordination of benefits is to ensure that your covered expenses
will be paid, while preventing duplicate benefit payments.
Here is how the coordination of benefits provision works:
l When your other coverage does not mention &quot;coordination of benefits,&quot; then that coverage pays first.
Benefits paid or payable by the other coverage will be taken into account in determining if additional
benefit payments can be made under your program.
l When the person who received care is covered as an employee under one contract, and as a dependent
under another, then the employee coverage pays first.
l When a dependent child is covered under two contracts whose parents are married or are living together,
whether or not they have ever been married, the contract which covers the person as a dependent of the
parent whose birthday (month and day) falls earliest in the calendar year will be primary. But, if both
parents have the same birthday, the program which covered the parent longer will be the primary
program.
l If the dependent child's parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have
ever been married, the following applies:
CERT-STU-2024
62

¡ if a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the dependent child's health care
expenses or health care coverage, that contract is the primary program;
¡ if a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the dependent child's health care
expenses or health care coverage, the provision for married or living together above shall determine
the order of benefits;
¡ if a court decree states the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has
responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the dependent child, the
provision for married or living together above shall determine the order of benefits; or
¡ if there is no court decree allocating responsibility for the dependent child's health care expenses or
health care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows:
i. the contract covering the custodial parent;
ii. the contract covering the spouse of custodial parent;
iii. the contract covering the non-custodial parent; and then
iv. the contract covering the spouse of the non-custodial parent
l If none of the above circumstances applies, the coverage you have had for the longest time pays first.
If you receive more than you should have when your benefits are coordinated, you will be expected to repay
any overpayment.
Prescription drug benefits are not coordinated against any other health care or drug benefit coverage.
Pediatric vision care benefits are not coordinated against any other health care or vision benefit coverage.
Force Majeure
*NTOCLVL2*Force Majeure*TOCLVL2* o failure, delay or default in performance of any obligation of Highmark shall constitute an event of default or
breach to the extent that such failure to perform, delay or default arises out of a cause, existing or future, that is
beyond the reasonable control and not the result of the negligence of Highmark. Such events include, by way
of illustration and not limitation, Acts of God, war (declared or undeclared), government regulation, acts or
inaction of governmental authority, civil or military authority, unforeseen disruptions caused by suppliers,
subcontractors, vendors or carriers, terrorism, disaster, strikes, civil-disorder, curtailment of transportation
facilities, fire, floods, blizzards, epidemics, pandemics, viral or communicable disease outbreaks, National
Emergency, quarantines, disruption of the labor force and/or any other cause which is beyond the reasonable
control of Highmark (hereinafter a &quot;Force Majeure Event&quot;), that makes it impossible, illegal or commercially
impracticable for Highmark to perform its obligations in whole or in part.
Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, Highmark shall take action to minimize the consequences of
the Force Majeure Event. If Highmark relies on any of the foregoing as an excuse for failure, default or delay in
performance, it shall give prompt written notice to the group of the facts that constitute such Force Majeure
Event, when it arose and when it is expected to cease.

*TOCLVL2*Notice of Claim and Proof of Loss*TOCLVL2* (Applies to Post-service Claims Only)
Network Providers have entered into an agreement with Highmark pertaining to the payment for covered
services that they provide to you. When you receive covered services from a network Provider, it is the
responsibility of the network provider to submit its claim to Highmark in accordance with the terms of its
participation agreement. Should the network provider fail to submit its claim in a timely manner or
otherwise satisfy Highmark’s requirements as they relate to the filing of claims, you will not be liable, and
the network provider shall hold you harmless relative to payment of the covered services that you
received.
When covered services are received from other than a network provider, you are responsible for
submitting the claim to Highmark. In such instances, you must submit the claim in accordance with the
following procedures:
Notice of Claim
Highmark will not be liable for any claims unless proper notice is furnished to Highmark that you have
received covered services. Written notice of a claim must be given to Highmark within 20 days or as soon
as reasonably possible after you have received covered services. Notice given by you or on your behalf
to Highmark that includes information sufficient to identify you shall constitute sufficient notice of a claim
to Highmark. You can give notice to Highmark by writing to the Member Service Department. The
address of the Member Service Department can be found on your ID card. A charge shall be considered
incurred on the date you receive the service or supply for which the charge is made.
Claim Forms
Proof of loss for covered services must be submitted to Highmark on the appropriate claim form.
Highmark, upon receipt of a notice of a claim will, within 15 days following the date a notice of a claim is
received, furnish you with claim forms for filing proofs of loss. If claim forms are not furnished within 15
days after the giving of such notice, you shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this
subsection as to filing a proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in this subsection for filing
proofs of loss, itemized bills for covered services as described below. The proof of loss may be submitted
to Highmark at the address appearing on your ID card.
Proof of Loss
Claims cannot be paid until a written proof of loss is submitted to Highmark. Written proof of loss must be
provided to Highmark within 90 days after the date of such loss. Proof of loss must include all data
necessary for Highmark to determine benefits. Failure to submit a proof of loss to Highmark within the
time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if it is shown that the proof of loss was submitted as
soon as reasonably possible, but in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, will Highmark be
required to accept a proof of loss later than 1 year from the time proof is otherwise required.
Submission of Claim Forms
The completed claim form, with all itemized bills attached, must be forwarded to Highmark at the address
appearing on your ID Card to satisfy the requirement of submitting a written proof of loss and to receive
payment for covered services.
To avoid delay in handling claims that you submit, answers to all questions on the claim form must be
complete and correct. Each claim form must be accompanied by itemized bills showing:
Person or organization providing the Service or supply

professional status of the nurse, and the signature of the professional provider prescribing the service.
Professional provider bills must show specific treatment dates. Drug and medicine bills must show
prescription number, date of purchase, and the patient's name. Your attending professional provider must
include a signature on all bills as certification that services have been prescribed, except for doctor bills,

include ambulance, prosthetic devices, rental of durable medical equipment, private duty nursing, etc.).
Itemized bills cannot be returned.
A request for payment of a claim will not be reviewed and no payment will be made unless all the
information and evidence of payment required on the claim form has been submitted in the manner
described above. Highmark reserves the right to require additional information and documents as needed
to support a claim that a covered service has been rendered.
Notice of Highmark’s claim determination will be issued within a reasonable period of time not to exceed
30 days following the receipt of a proper proof of loss. This period of time may be extended one time by
Highmark for an additional period of time not to exceed 15 days provided the extension is due to matters
outside the control of Highmark and a written explanation for the delay is provided to you.
If Highmark renders an adverse decision on the claim, the notification shall include, among other items,
the specific reason or reasons for the adverse decision and a statement describing your right to file an
appeal.
Time of Payment of Claims
Claim payments for benefits payable under this Certificate will be processed immediately upon receipt of
a proper proof of loss.

additional time is necessary due to matters outside its control, and notifies you of the extension prior to
the expiration of the initial 30-day post-service claim determination period. If an extension of time is
necessary because you failed to submit information necessary for Highmark to make a decision on your
post-service claim, the notice of extension that is sent to you will specifically describe the information that
you must submit. In this event, you will have at least 45 days in which to submit the information before a

qualified personnel with experience in the same or similar scope of practice. All notices of these decisions will
include information regarding the basis for the determination.
Highmark maintains both a complaint and an adverse benefit determination process. At any time during either
of these processes, you may designate an authorized representative to participate in the process on your
behalf. An authorized representative can be (i) a person (including your provider) to whom you have given
express written consent to represent you in a complaint or adverse benefit determination process; (ii) a person
authorized by law to provide substituted consent for you; or (iii) a family member or treating provider involved in
providing health care to you, if you are incapacitated or unable to provide consent due to a medical emergency
or as necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to your health or safety.
You or your authorized representative shall notify Highmark, in writing, of the designation. If an authorize
representative is designated, you may not file a separate complaint or adverse benefit determination appeal.
You may rescind the authorized representative designation at any time. In the event that your authorized
representative fails to file or pursue either a complaint or appeal of an adverse benefit determination, the
authorized representative designation shall be automatically removed. Highmark reserves the right to establish
reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been authorized to act on your behalf.

Internal Adverse Benefit Determination Process
Highmark maintains an internal appeal process involving one level of review for adverse benefit
determinations. Adverse benefit determinations include the following:
l a decision by Highmark that, based upon the information provided and utilization review, a request
for a benefit does not meet Highmark’s requirements for medical necessity, appropriateness, health
care setting, level of care or effectiveness or is determined to be experimental or investigational,
such that the requested benefit is therefore denied, reduced or terminated or payment is not
provided or made, in whole or in part, for the benefit;
CERT-STUD-2024
72

l the denial, reduction, termination or failure to provide or make payment, in whole or in part, for a
benefit based on Highmark’s determination of your eligibility for coverage under your benefit
program or noncompliance with an administrative policy or
l a rescission of coverage determination by Highmark.
An adverse benefit determination does not involve a complaint.
If you receive notice of an adverse benefit determination, you have one hundred-eighty (180) days from the
date of your receipt of notification of the adverse decision to submit an appeal.
Upon receipt of the appeal, Highmark will provide written confirmation to you that the request has been
received, and that Highmark has classified it as an adverse benefit determination for purposes of internal
review.
Upon request to Highmark, you may review all documents, records and other information relevant to your
appeal and shall have the right to submit or present additional evidence or testimony which includes any
written or oral statements, comments and/or remarks, documents, records, information, data or other material
in support of your appeal.
Your appeal will be reviewed by a representative from the Member Grievance and Appeals Department. The
representative shall not have been involved or be the subordinate of any individual that was involved in any
previous decision to deny the claim or matter which is the subject of your appeal. In rendering a decision on
your appeal, the Member Grievance and Appeals Department will take into account all evidence, comments,
testimony, documents, records, and other information submitted by you without regard to whether such
information was previously submitted to or considered by Highmark. The Member Grievance and Appeals
Department will afford no deference to any prior adverse decision on the claim which is the subject of your
appeal.
Each appeal will be promptly evaluated, and Highmark will provide written notification of its decision within the
following time frames:
l When the appeal involves a non-urgent care pre-service claim, within a reasonable period of time
appropriate to the medical circumstances involved not to exceed thirty (30) days following receipt of
the appeal;
l When the appeal involves an urgent care claim, an admission, availability of care, continued stay or
service for which you have received emergency care services but have not been discharged from a
facility, or a determination that a service is experimental/investigative and, based on the written
certification of the treating Provider, would be significantly less effective if not promptly initiated, as
soon as possible taking into account the medical exigencies involved but not later than seventy-two
(72) hours following receipt of the appeal; or
l When the appeal involves a post-service claim, a decision by Highmark to rescind coverage, or for
any other adverse benefit determination not set forth above, within a reasonable period of time not
to exceed thirty (30) days following receipt of the appeal.
If Highmark fails to provide notice of its decision within the above-stated time frames or otherwise fails to
strictly adhere to these appeal procedures, you may be permitted to request an external review and/or pursue
any applicable right to arbitration.

other items, the specific reason or reasons for the adverse decision including clinical rationale, the procedure
for appealing the decision and a statement regarding your right to pursue legal action.

External Adverse Benefit Determination Process
If you receive an adverse benefit determination, you may appeal such decision to an external entity. The type
of external review is dependent upon the type of adverse benefit determination.
If the adverse benefit determination is an administrative denial, meaning that the adverse decision was based
on:
l Prior authorization, coverage or payment based on a lack of eligibility, failure to submit complete
information or other failure to comply with an administrative policy; or
l is a rescission of coverage,
you must follow the appeal process outlined in the External Appeal of Administrative Denial paragraph below.
If the adverse benefit determination was based on:
l Medical necessity and appropriateness
l Health care setting;
l Level of care;
l Effectiveness of a covered service; or
l Relates to a claim regarding Highmark’s compliance with the surprise billing and cost-sharing
protections under the federal No Surprises Act,
You must follow the appeal process outlined in the External Review of Non-Administrative Denials paragraph
below.
External Appeal of Administrative Denial
You will have fifteen (15) days from the receipt of the notice of Highmark’s adverse decision on the internal
appeal on an administrative denial to appeal the decision to the Department.
All records from the internal process for the administrative denial will be forwarded to the Department in the
manner prescribed. You and Highmark may submit additional material related to the administrative denial to
the Department. You may be represented by an attorney or other individual before the Department.
External Review of Non-Administrative Denials
You shall have four (4) months from the receipt of the notice of an adverse benefit determination of a
non-administrative denial to file a request for an external review of an adverse benefit determination resulting
with the Department. Administrative denials are not eligible for this external review process and must be
appealed as set forth in the External Appeal of Administrative Denial paragraph, above.
Except in the instance of a request for expedited external review, the request for external review should be
filed in writing to the Department. The Department may prescribe the form and content of the external review
request, but the request must include an authorization form authorizing the Plan and provider to disclose
pertinent protected health information to the external review. The request should include the reasons, material
justification and all reasonably necessary supporting information as part of the external review request.
CERT-STUD-2024
74

Preliminary Review and Notification
Within one (1) business day from receipt of the request for external review, the Department shall send a copy
of the request to Highmark. Within five (5) business days from receipt of the copy of the request for external
review, Highmark will complete a preliminary review of the external review request to determine:
l whether you are or were covered under this program at the time the service which is the subject of
the denied claim was or would have been received;
l whether the service, which is the subject of the denied claim, is not a covered service under this
because it does not meet the Plan’s requirements as to Medical Necessity and Appropriateness,
health care setting, level of care or effectiveness of a Covered Service, or because the Plan
determined the service to be Experimental/Investigative for a particular medical condition;
l with respect to denials based on the experimental and investigational nature of the service, whether
your Provider has certified that: (1) standard health care services have not been effective, are not
medically appropriate or that no alternative covered service is more beneficial than the service that
is the subject of the denial; and (2) that the recommended service is likely to be more than available
standard health care services, or that scientifically valid studies using accepted protocols
demonstrate that the requested service requested is likely to be more beneficial to you than any
available standard health care services;
l whether you have exhausted Highmark's internal appeal process, unless otherwise not required to
exhaust that process; and
l whether you have provided all the information and any applicable forms required to process the
external review request.
Within one (1) business day following completion of its preliminary review of the request, Highmark shall in
writing notify you and the Department of its determination.
In the event that the external review request is not complete, the notification will describe the information or
materials needed to complete the request.
In the event that the external review request is complete but not eligible for external review, notification by
Highmark will include the reasons why the request is ineligible for external review. Highmark’s determination
that the request is not eligible for external review may be appealed to the Department.
Final Review and Notification
Within one (1) business day from receipt of the notification that the request is complete and eligible for external
review, the Department shall assign an independent review organization (IRO) to conduct the external review
and notify Highmark of the assignment. If the request relates to a determination that the treatment is
experimental or investigative, within one (1) business day of receipt of the assignment notification, the IRO
shall select one or more clinical reviewers to conduct the external review. The Department shall notify you that
the request has been accepted and is eligible for external review. The notice will further state that any
additional information which you may have in support of the request must be submitted, in writing, within fifteen
(15) business days for a standard external review request, or within five (5) business days if the external
review relates to an experimental or investigative service, following receipt of the notice.
Any additional information timely submitted by you and received by the assigned IRO will be forwarded to
Highmark within one (1) business day of receipt. Upon receipt of the information, Highmark shall be permitted
an opportunity to reconsider its prior decision regarding the claim that was denied or the matter which is the
subject of the external review request. Reconsideration by Highmark of its prior decision may not delay or
terminate the external review. The external review may be terminated without a determination by the IRO only
if Highmark reverses its prior decision and provides coverage or payment for the claim that is the subject of the
external review. Within one (1) business day of making the decision to reverse its prior determination,
CERT-STUD-2024
75

Highmark shall notify the Department, the assigned IRO and you, in writing, of its decision. Upon receipt of
such notice, the assigned IRO shall terminate the external review.
The assigned IRO or clinical reviewer will review all information and documents that it timely received and
make a decision on the external review request. Decisions or conclusions reached during Highmark’s internal
appeal process are not binding on the IRO or clinical reviewer. The assigned IRO shall provide written notice of
the final external review decision to the Department, Highmark and you within forty-five (45) days from receipt
by the IRO of the external review request. Written notice of the decision shall provide, among other

l an urgent care claim;
l an admission, availability of care, continued stay or service for which you received emergency care
services but have not been discharged from a facility; or
l a determination the service is experimental or investigational and, based on the written certification
of the treating Provider, would be significantly less effective if not promptly initiated,
you may request an expedited external review of Highmark's decision. An expedited external review may not
be provided for retrospective adverse benefit determinations.
A request for an expedited external review must be submitted to the Department. Upon receipt of a request for
an expedited external review, the Department shall, within twenty-four (24) hours, send a copy of the request
to Highmark.

twenty-four (24) hours following completion of this preliminary review of the expedited external review request,
Highmark shall notify the Department and you of its determination. Highmark’s determination that the request
is not eligible for expedited external review may be appealed to the Department.

Highmark of the assignment. Upon receipt of the notification of the IRO assignment, Highmark shall transmit
documents and information considered in making the adverse benefit determination to the assigned IRO in an
expeditious manner. Decisions or conclusions reached during Highmark's determination or Highmark's Internal
Adverse Benefit Determination Process are not binding on the IRO. The assigned IRO will conduct the review
and provide notice of its final external review decision as expeditiously as your medical condition or
circumstances require, but in no event more than seventy-two (72) hours following receipt by the IRO of the
request for expedited external review. If notice of the decision by the IRO is not provided in writing, the IRO
must provide within forty-eight (48) hours following initial notice of its final external review decision, written
confirmation of that decision to Highmark, you, and the Department. Written notice of the decision shall
provide, among other information, a statement of the principal reasons for the decision including the rationale
and standards relied upon by the IRO. Upon receipt of notice that Highmark’s decision was reversed by the

DESCRIPTION OF COVERAGE: This program sets forth a comprehensive program of inpatient and outpatient
benefits, most of which are provided at both network and out-of-network levels of benefits. Cost-sharing
options are available such as deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, and annual and lifetime maximums.
Benefits for certain services are only available if received from a network provider. Benefits are subject to the
Health Care Management Services Section with possible loss of benefits for non-compliance. Network services
are limited to the Keystone Health Plan West Network, the PremierBlue Shield Preferred Professional Provider
Network, the Highmark Blue Shield Participating Facility Provider Network and/or the Local PPO Network.
Network services are usually provided at a higher level of benefits than out-of-network services. Benefits for
pediatric dental services are only available through the United Concordia Advantage Provider Network and
benefits for vision care services are only available through the Davis Vision Network. A gatekeeper is not
necessary to access benefits from providers. This Contract is non-participating in any divisible surplus of
premium. The coverage provided under this Contract has an actuarial value of 91.36% which provides a
Platinum level of coverage.
(NOTE: All networks described within this Contract have been approved by the Pennsylvania Department of
Health, except for the network described as the Local PPO Network. The Plan reserves the right to use other
networks approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Health in the future, after notice to the Pennsylvania
Insurance Department.)

Benefits to which You are Entitled
Highmark's benefit liability is limited to the benefits specified in this Health Care Certificate. Except as provided
in the Transplant Services description, no person other than a member is entitled to receive benefits under this
Health Care Certificate. Such right to benefits and coverage is not transferable. Benefits for covered services
specified herein will be provided only for services and supplies rendered by providers as defined in this Health
Care Certificate.
Non-Assignment
Unless otherwise required by law, Highmark is authorized by the member to make payments directly to
providers furnishing Covered Services provided under the program described in this certificate; however,
Highmark reserves the right to make these payments directly to the member. The right of a member to receive
payment for a Covered Service described in this certificate is not assignable, except to the extent required by
law, nor may benefits described in this certificate be transferred either before or after Covered Services are
rendered. Any (direct or indirect) attempt to accomplish such an assignment shall be null and void. Nothing
contained in this certificate shall be construed to make Highmark, the group or the student health insurance
program sponsor liable to any assignee to whom a member may be liable for medical care, treatment, or
services.

    <page number="6">Introduction to Your Health Care Program
*TTOCLVL1*Introduction to Your Health Care Program*TOCLVL1* his certificate provides you with the information you need to understand your health care program. We
encourage you to take the time to review this information, so you understand how your health care program
works.
Refer to the Summary of Benefits at the end of this certificate. The Summary of Benefits will tell you what you
need to know about your benefits, exclusions and how your plan works.
For a number of reasons, we think you'll be pleased with your health care program:
l Your health care program gives you freedom of choice. You are not required to select a primary care
provider to receive covered care. You have access to a large provider network of physicians, hospitals,
and other providers in Pennsylvania, as well as providers across the country who are part of the local
PPO network. For a higher level of coverage, you need to receive care from one of these network
providers. However, you can go outside the network and still receive care at the lower level of coverage.
To locate a network provider near you, or to learn whether your current physician is in the network, log
onto your Highmark member website, www.myhighmark.com.
l Your health care program gives you &quot;stay healthy&quot; care. You are covered for a range of preventive
care, including physical examinations and selected diagnostic tests. Preventive care is a proactive
approach to health management that can help you stay on top of your health status and prevent more
serious, costly care down the road.
You can review your Preventive Care Guidelines online at your member website. And, as a member of your
health care program, you get important extras. Along with 24-hour assistance with any health care question via
Blues On Call, your member website connects you to a range of self-service tools that can help you manage
your coverage. You can also access programs and services designed to help you make and maintain healthy
improvements. And you can access a wide range of care cost and care provider quality tools to assure you
spend your health care dollars wisely.
We understand that prescription drug coverage is of particular concern to our members. You'll find in-depth
information on these benefits in this certificate.
If you have any questions on your health care program, please call the Member Service toll-free telephone
number on the back of your ID card. For TTY/TDD hearing impaired service, please dial 711 and the number
on the back of your ID card.
Information for Non-English-Speaking Members
Non-English-speaking members have access to clear benefits information. They can call the toll-free Member
Service telephone number on the back of their ID card to be connected to a language services interpreter line.
Highmark Member Service representatives are trained to make the connection.
As always, we value you as a member, look forward to providing your coverage, and wish you good health.

*TEMPLATE*CCBSPA_CERT_MEDICAL*TEMPLATE*
*YTOCLVL1*How Your Health Care Program Works*TOCLVL1* our program is responsive, flexible coverage that lets you get the medically necessary and appropriate care
you want from the health care provider you select.
Here is how your health care program works. When you or a covered family member needs certain medical
services, including:
l Primary care provider office visits
l Specialist office visits
l Physical, speech and occupational therapy
l Diagnostic services
l Inpatient and outpatient hospital services
l Home health or hospice care
Network Care
*NTOCLVL2*Network Care*TOCLVL2* etwork care is care you receive from providers in your program's network.
When you receive health care within the network, you enjoy maximum coverage and maximum convenience.
You present your ID card to the provider who submits your claim.
Out-of-Network Care
*OTOCLVL2*Out-of-Network Care*TOCLVL2* ut-of-network care is care you receive from providers who are not in your program's network.
Out-of-network providers are not in the program's network. When using out-of-network providers, you may still
have coverage for most eligible services, except you will share more financial and paperwork responsibilities.
In addition, you may be responsible for paying any differences between the program's payments and the
provider's actual charges. Finally, you may need to file your own claims and obtain precertification for inpatient
care. You should always check with the provider before getting care to understand at what level your care will
be covered.
Remember: If you want to enjoy maximum benefits coverage, you need to be sure you receive care
from a network provider. See the Summary of Benefits for your coverage details.
Even though a hospital may be in our network, not every doctor providing services in that hospital is in
the network. For example: If you are having surgery, make sure that all of your providers, including
surgeons, anesthesiologists and radiologists, are in the network.
Out-of-Area Care
*YTOCLVL2*Out-of-Area Care*TOCLVL2* our program also provides coverage for you and your eligible dependents when you receive care from
providers located outside of Pennsylvania. For specific details, see the Inter-Plan Arrangements section of this
certificate.
If you are traveling and an urgent injury or illness occurs, you should seek treatment from the nearest hospital,
emergency room or clinic: If the treatment results in an admission the provider must obtain precertification from
Highmark. However, it is important that you confirm Highmark's determination of medical necessity and
appropriateness. If precertification is not obtained and the admission is not considered to be medically
CERT-STU-2024

    <page number="43">necessary and appropriate, you will be responsible for all costs associated with the stay. For specific details,
see the Health Care Management section of this certificate.
Provider Reimbursement and Member Liability
*HTOCLVL2*Provider Reimbursement and Member Liability*TOCLVL2* ighmark uses the Plan Allowance to calculate the benefit payable and the financial liability of the member for
Medically Necessary and Appropriate Services covered under this plan. Refer to the Terms You Should Know
section for the definition of Plan Allowance.
Highmark's payment is determined by first subtracting any deductible and/or copayment liability from the Plan
Allowance. The coinsurance percentage set forth in the Summary of Benefits is then applied to that amount.
This amount represents Highmark's payment. Any remaining coinsurance amount is the member's
responsibility. The member's total cost-sharing liability is the sum of the coinsurance plus any deductible
and/or copayment obligations.
When a member receives covered services from an out-of-network provider, in addition to the member's
cost-sharing liability described above, the member is responsible for the difference between Highmark's
payment and the provider's billed charge. If a member receives services which are not covered under this plan,
the member is responsible for all charges associated with those services.
However, the following covered services when received from an out-of-network provider will be provided at the
network services level of benefits and you will not be responsible for such difference:
1. Emergency care services; and
2. Ambulance services, when provided in conjunction with emergency care services or when provided by
air.
Additionally, in very limited circumstances, you may not be liable for charges for non-emergency covered
services received from certain professional providers or ancillary providers who are not part of the network.
When you are a patient at a network facilty provider, a professional provider or ancillary provider who is not
part of the network may render certain items and professional services (such as, but not limited to
consultations, equipment, devices, anesthesiology, radiology or pathology services) to you. The selection of
such professional providers or ancillary providers may be beyond your control. In that situation, you will not be
liable, except for applicable network deductible, copayment or coinsurance obligations, for the charges of the
professional provider or ancillary provider.
Inter-Plan Arrangements
*OTOCLVL2*Inter-Plan Arrangements*TOCLVL2* ut-of-Area Services
Highmark has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees referred to
generally as &quot;inter-plan arrangements.&quot; These inter-plan arrangements operate under rules and procedures
issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Whenever members access health care services outside of
Pennsylvania, the claim for those services may be processed through one of these inter-plan arrangements, as
described generally below.
Typically, when accessing care outside of Pennsylvania, members obtain care from providers that have a
contractual agreement (&quot;participating providers&quot;) with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that
other geographic area (&quot;Host Blue&quot;). In some instances, members may obtain care from providers in the Host
Blue geographic area that do not have a contractual agreement (&quot;non-participating providers&quot;) with the Host
Blue. Highmark remains responsible for fulfilling our contractual obligations to you. Highmark's payment
practices in both instances are described below.
CERT-STU-2024
43</page>
    <page number="44">BlueCard® Program
The BlueCard® Program is an inter-plan arrangement. Under this arrangement, when members access
covered services outside of Pennsylvania, the Host Blue will be responsible for contracting and handling all
interactions with its participating health care providers.
The financial terms of the BlueCard Program are described generally below.
Liability Calculation Method per Claim
Unless subject to a fixed dollar copayment, the calculation of the member liability on claims for covered
services processed through the BlueCard Program will be based on the lower of the participating provider's
billed charges for covered services or the negotiated price made available to Highmark by the Host Blue.
Host Blues determine a negotiated price, which is reflected in the terms of each Host Blue's health care
provider contracts. The negotiated price made available to Highmark by the Host Blue may be represented by
one of the following:
l an actual price - An actual price is a negotiated rate of payment in effect at the time a claim is processed
without any other increases or decreases, or
l an estimated price - An estimated price is a negotiated rate of payment in effect at the time a claim is
processed, reduced or increased by a percentage to take into account certain payments negotiated with
the provider and other claim- and non-claim-related transactions. Such transactions may include, but are
not limited to, anti-fraud and abuse recoveries, provider refunds not applied on a claim-specific basis,
retrospective settlements and performance-related bonuses or incentives, or
l an average price - An average price is a percentage of billed charges for covered services in effect at the
time a claim is processed representing the aggregate payments negotiated by the Host Blue with all of its
providers or a similar classification of its providers and other claim- and non-claim-related transactions.
Such transactions may include the same ones as noted above for an estimated price.
Host Blues determine whether or not they will use an actual price, estimated or average price. Host Blues
using either an estimated price or an average price may prospectively increase or reduce such prices to
correct for over- or underestimation of past prices, (i.e., prospective adjustment may mean that a current price
reflects additional amounts or credits for claims already paid or anticipated to be paid to providers or refunds
received or anticipated to be received from providers). However, the BlueCard Program requires that the
amount paid by the member is a final price; no future price adjustment will result in increases or decreases to
the pricing of past claims. The method of claims payment by Host Blues is taken into account by Highmark in
determining the member's premiums.
Special Cases: Value-Based Programs
Highmark has included a factor for bulk distributions from Host Blues in your premium for Value-Based
Programs when applicable under your program. Additional information is available upon request.
Return of Overpayments
Recoveries of overpayments from a Host Blue or its participating and non-participating providers can arise in
several ways, including, but not limited to, anti-fraud and abuse recoveries, provider/hospital bill audits, credit
balance audits, utilization review refunds and unsolicited refunds. Recoveries will be applied so that corrections
will be made, in general, on either a claim-by-claim or prospective basis. If recovery amounts are passed on a
claim-by-claim basis from a Host Blue to Highmark, they will be credited to your account. In some cases, the
Host Blue will engage a third party to assist in identification or collection of overpayments. The fees of such a
third party may be charged to you as a percentage of the recovery.
CERT-STU-2024

    <page number="45">Inter-Plan Programs: Federal State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees
In some instances, federal or state laws or regulations may impose a surcharge, tax or other fee that applies to
insured accounts. If applicable, Highmark will include any such surcharge, tax or other fee in determining your
premium.
Non-Participating Providers Outside Pennsylvania
Member Liability Calculation
When covered services are provided outside Pennsylvania by non-participating providers, the amount(s) a
member pays for such services will generally be based on either the Host Blue's non-participating provider
local payment or the pricing arrangements required by applicable law. In these situations, the member may be
responsible for the difference between the amount that the non-participating provider bills and the payment
Highmark will make for the covered services as set forth in this paragraph. Payments for emergency services
rendered by non-participating providers will be governed by applicable federal and state law.
Exceptions
In some exception cases, Highmark may pay claims from non-participating providers outside Pennsylvania
based on the provider's billed charge. This may occur in situations where a Member did not have reasonable
access to the participating provider, as determined by Highmark in Highmark's sole and absolute discretion or
by applicable law. In other exception cases, Highmark may pay such claims based on the payment Highmark
would make if Highmark were paying a non-participating provider for the same covered service inside the Plan
Service Area as described elsewhere in this document. This may occur where the Host Blue's corresponding
payment would be more than the plan in-service area non-participating provider payment. Highmark may
choose to negotiate a payment with such a provider on an exception basis.
Unless otherwise stated, in any of these exception situations, the Member may be responsible for the
difference between the amount that the non-participating provider bills and payment Highmark will make for the
covered services as set forth in this paragraph.
Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program
If members are outside the United States (hereinafter &quot;BlueCard service area&quot;), they may be able to take
advantage of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program when accessing covered services. The Blue
Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program is unlike the BlueCard Program available in the BlueCard service area
in certain ways. For instance, although the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program assists members with
accessing a network of inpatient, outpatient and professional providers, the network is not served by a Host
Blue. As such, when members receive care from providers outside the BlueCard service area, they will
typically have to pay the providers and submit the claims themselves to obtain reimbursement for these
services.
Inpatient Services
In most cases, if members contact the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core service center (&quot;service center&quot;) for
assistance, hospitals will not require members to pay for inpatient covered services, except for their
cost-sharing amounts. In such cases, a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core contracting hospital will submit
member claims to the service center to initiate claims processing. However, if the member paid in full at the
time of service, the member must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement for covered services. Members
must contact Highmark to obtain precertification or preauthorization for non-emergency inpatient
services.
Outpatient Services
Physicians, urgent care centers and other outpatient providers located outside the BlueCard service area will
typically require members to pay in full at the time of service. Members must submit a claim to obtain
reimbursement for covered services.
CERT-STU-2024
45</page>
    <page number="46">Submitting a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Claim
When members pay for covered services outside the BlueCard service area, they must submit a claim to
obtain reimbursement. For institutional and professional claims, members should complete a Blue Cross Blue
Shield Global Core International claim form and send the claim form with the provider's itemized bill(s) to the
service center address on the form to initiate claims processing. The claim form is available from Highmark, the
service center or online at www.bcbsglobalcore.com. If members need assistance with their claim
submissions, they should call the service center at 800-810-BLUE (2583) or call collect at 804-673-1177, 24
hours a day, seven days a week.
Your Provider Network
*TTOCLVL2*Your Provider Network*TOCLVL2* he network includes: primary care providers; a wide range of specialists; mental health and substance abuse
providers; community and specialty hospitals; and laboratories.
To determine if your physician is in the network, call the Member Service toll-free telephone number on the
back of your ID card, or log onto www.myhighmark.com.
Getting your care &quot;through the network&quot; also assures you get quality care. All physicians are carefully
evaluated before they are accepted into the network. We consider educational background, office procedures
and performance history to determine eligibility. Then we monitor care on an ongoing basis through office
record reviews and patient satisfaction surveys.
Please note that while you or a family member can use the services, including behavioral health and
well-woman care, of any network physician or specialist without a referral and receive the maximum coverage
under your benefit program, you are encouraged to select a personal or primary care provider. This helps
establish an ongoing relationship based on knowledge and trust and helps make your care consistent. Your
personal provider can help you select an appropriate specialist and work closely with that specialist when the
need arises. In addition, primary care providers or their covering physicians are on call 24/7.
Remember:
It is your responsibility to ensure that you receive network care. You may want to double-check any
provider recommendations to make sure the doctor or facility is in the network.

Prescription Drug Providers
*YTOCLVL2*Prescription Drug Providers*TOCLVL2* ou must purchase drugs from a network pharmacy to be eligible for benefits under this program. No benefits
are available if drugs are purchased from a non-network pharmacy.
l Network Pharmacy: Network pharmacies have an arrangement with Highmark to provide
prescription drugs to you at an agreed upon price. When you purchase covered drugs from a
pharmacy in the network applicable to your program, present your prescription and ID card to the
pharmacist. (Prescriptions that the pharmacy receives by phone from your physician or dentist may
also be covered.) You should request and retain a receipt for any amounts you have paid if needed
for income tax or any other purpose.
If you travel within the United States and need to refill a prescription, call Member Service for help. They
can help you find a network pharmacy near the area you are visiting. You also can use the member
website to find a pharmacy. Once you have the name and address of the network pharmacy, take the
prescription bottle to that pharmacy. The pharmacist will contact your home pharmacy to start the refill
process. Note: Save the new medicine container. This will make it easier to transfer the
prescription back to your pharmacy at home.
l Mail Order Pharmacy: Express Scripts® is your program's mail order pharmacy. This option offers
savings and convenience for prescriptions you may take on an ongoing basis.
To start using mail order:
1. Ask your doctor to write a prescription for up to a 90-day supply, plus refills for up to one year, if
appropriate.
2. Complete the Pharmacy Mail Order Form and Health, Allergy &amp; Medication Questionnaire. You can
get these forms by calling Member Service or from your member website. After logging in, click on
the &quot;Prescriptions&quot; tab. Scroll down the page to &quot;Forms to Manage Your Plan&quot; and click on &quot;Mail
order form and health questionnaire (PDF)&quot;.

    <page number="49">3. Send the completed forms and your payment to the address listed on the mail order form. It usually
takes about five days to get your prescription after it has been processed.
Your mail order will include directions for ordering refills.
l Exclusive Pharmacy Provider: The exclusive pharmacy provider has an agreement, either
directly or indirectly, with Highmark pertaining to the payment and exclusive dispensing of selected
prescription drugs provided to you. Please refer to the Description of Benefits - Prescription Drug
Program section for a list of the selected prescription drug categories.

*FTOCLVL2*Medical Management*TOCLVL2* or your benefits to be paid under your program, services and supplies must be considered medically
necessary and appropriate. However, not all medically necessary and appropriate services and supplies are
covered under your program.
Highmark, or its designated agent, is responsible for determining whether care is medically necessary and
provided in the appropriate setting.
A Highmark nurse will review your request for an inpatient admission to ensure it is appropriate for the
treatment of your condition, illness, disease or injury, in accordance with standards of good medical practice,
and the most appropriate supply or level of service that can safely be provided to you. When applied to
hospitalization, this further means that you require acute care as an inpatient due to the nature of the services
rendered for your condition and you cannot receive safe or adequate care as an outpatient.
Benefits after Provider Termination from the Network
*ITOCLVL2*Benefits after Provider Termination from the Network*TOCfLVL2*, at the time you are receiving medical care from a network provider, notice is received from Highmark that
Highmark intends to terminate or has terminated all or portions of the contract of that network provider for
reasons other than cause; or the contract of that network will not be renewed, or the participation status of the
network provider is changing, you may, at your option, continue an active course of treatment with that provider
until the treatment is complete or for a period of up to ninety (90) days from the date the notification of the
termination or pending termination is received, whichever is shorter. For purposes of this subsection, active
course of treatment means;
1. an ongoing course of treatment for a life-threatening condition, defined as a disease or condition for
which likelihood of death is probable unless the course of the disease or condition is interrupted;
2. an ongoing course of treatment for a serious acute condition, defined as a disease or condition
requiring specialized medical treatment to avoid the reasonable possibility of death or permanent
harm or complex ongoing care which you are currently receiving, such as chemotherapy, radiation
therapy or post-operative visits;
3. confirmed pregnancy, through the postpartum period;
4. scheduled non-elective surgery, through post-operative care;
5. an ongoing course of treatment for a health condition that is life-threatening, degenerative,
potentially disabling or congenital and that requires specialized medical care over a prolonged
period of time or for which a treating physician or health care provider attests that discontinuing
care by that physician or health care provider would worsen the condition or interfere with
anticipated outcomes; or
6. treatment for a terminal illness.
If, however, the network provider is terminated for cause and you continue to seek treatment from that
provider, Highmark will not be liable for payment for health care services provided to you following the date of
termination.
CERT-STU-2024
50</page>
    <page number="51">Any services authorized under this subsection will be covered in accordance with the same terms and
conditions as applicable to a network provider. Nothing in this subsection shall require Highmark to pay
benefits for health care services that are not otherwise provided herein.
Transition of Care
If you are receiving medical care from an out-of-network provider, which is not otherwise covered by prior
coverage, at the time when your coverage under this Certificate begins, you may opt to continue an ongoing
course of treatment with that provider for a period of up to sixty (60) days. However, if you are in the second or
third trimester of pregnancy when this coverage begins, the transition of care period shall extend through
postpartum care related to the delivery. You must notify Highmark as soon as possible of your request to
continue an ongoing course of treatment for the transition of care period by calling the Member Service toll-free
telephone number on the back of your ID card.
Emergency Care Services - No Prior Approval Requirement
In the event that you require emergency care services, all charges for such covered services will be paid at the
network services level of benefits. No prior authorization is required for emergency care services. In the event
of an inpatient admission, you, your provider or a family member must notify Highmark within forty-eight (48)
hours of the admission, or as soon as reasonably possible. Once you are stabilized Highmark may offer to
transfer your care from an out-of-network provider to a network provider.
Pre-Admission Certification
When you require inpatient facility care, benefits for covered services will be provided as follows:
In-Area Network Care
When you use a network facility provider for inpatient care for other than an emergency admission, the facility
will contact Highmark prior to the proposed admission, or within 48 hours or as soon as reasonably possible
after an emergency admission, to obtain precertification for the admission.
You will be held harmless whenever precertification for an admission is not obtained. If the admission is
determined not to be medically necessary and appropriate, you will be held harmless, except when Highmark
provides prior written notice to you that the admission will not be covered. In such case, you will be financially
responsible for charges for that admission.
Out-of-Area Network Care
In the event of a proposed inpatient stay for other than an emergency admission to a network facility provider
located out-of-area, the facility will contact Highmark prior to the proposed admission, or within 48 hours or as
soon as reasonably possible after an emergency admission, to obtain precertification for the admission. You
are also responsible for contacting Highmark at the toll-free number listed on the back of your ID card to
confirm Highmark's determination of medical necessity and appropriateness.
If precertification for a medically necessary and appropriate inpatient admission has been obtained, benefits for
covered services will be provided. If a network facility does not contact Highmark for precertification, the
inpatient admission will be reviewed for medical necessity and appropriateness. It is important that you
confirm Highmark's determination of medical necessity and appropriateness. If your admission is
determined not to be medically necessary and appropriate, you will be responsible for the full amount
of the network facility provider's charge.
If you elect to be admitted after receiving written notification from Highmark that any portion of the proposed
admission is not medically necessary and appropriate, you will be financially responsible for all charges
associated with that portion of care. In an emergency admission, if you elect to remain hospitalized after
receiving written notification from Highmark that the level of care is no longer medically necessary and
CERT-STU-2024
51</page>
    <page number="52">appropriate, you will be financially responsible for all charges from the date appearing on the written
notification.
Out-of-area network providers are not obligated to abide by any determination of medical necessity and
appropriateness rendered by Highmark. You may, therefore, receive services which are not medically
necessary and appropriate for which you will be solely responsible.
Out-of-Network Care
In the event of a proposed inpatient stay for other than an emergency admission to an out-of-network facility
provider, you are responsible for notifying Highmark prior to your proposed admission or within 48 hours or
as soon as reasonably possible after an emergency admission. However, some facility providers will contact
Highmark and obtain precertification of the inpatient admission on your behalf. Be sure to verify that your
provider is contacting Highmark for precertification. If not, you are responsible for contacting Highmark.
If precertification for a medically necessary and appropriate inpatient admission has been obtained, benefits for
covered services will be provided. If you do not contact Highmark for precertification as required, the inpatient
admission will be reviewed for medical necessity and appropriateness. If your admission is determined not
to be medically necessary and appropriate, you will be responsible for the full amount of the
out-of-network facility provider's charge.
If you elect to be admitted after receiving written notification from Highmark that any portion of the proposed
admission is not medically necessary and appropriate, you will be financially responsible for all charges
associated with that portion of care. In an emergency admission, if you elect to remain hospitalized after
receiving written notification from Highmark that the level of care is no longer medically necessary and
appropriate, you will be financially responsible for all charges from the date appearing on the written
notification.
Care Utilization Review Process
*ITOCLVL2*Care Utilization Review Process*TOCLVL2*n order to assess whether care is provided in the appropriate setting, Highmark administers a care utilization
review program comprised of prospective, concurrent and/or retrospective reviews. In addition, Highmark
assists hospitals with discharge planning. These activities are conducted by a Highmark nurse working with a
medical director. Here is a brief description of these review procedures:
Prospective Review
Prospective review, also known as precertification or pre-service review, begins upon receipt of treatment
information. Upon receipt and review of a precertification request from a provider, if Highmark determines that
information is missing that is needed in order to make a decision, Highmark will notify the requesting provider
that the information is missing. Highmark will identify the missing information with enough specificity so that the
provider can submit the information needed to Highmark.
After receiving the request for care, Highmark:
l verifies your eligibility for coverage and availability of benefits;
l reviews diagnosis and plan of treatment;
l assesses whether care is medically necessary and appropriate;
l makes a decision regarding the request, and if approved, authorizes care and assigns an
appropriate length of stay for inpatient admissions.
CERT-STU-2024
52</page>
    <page number="53">In making a decision regarding the precertification request, Highmark will consider medical policies,
administrative policies, your relevant medical information, and medical or scientific evidence submitted by your
provider.
Concurrent Review
Concurrent review may occur during the course of ongoing treatment and is used to assess the medical
necessity and appropriateness of the length of stay and level of care. At the time of the review, Highmark will
verify your eligibility for coverage and availability of benefits and assess whether the care is medically
necessary and appropriate. In making a decision, Highmark will consider its medical policies, administrative
policies, your relevant medical information, and medical or scientific evidence submitted by your provider.
Discharge Planning
Discharge planning is a process that begins prior to your scheduled hospital admission. Working with you, your
family, your attending physician(s) and hospital staff, Highmark will help plan for and coordinate your discharge
to assure that you receive safe and uninterrupted care when needed at the time of discharge.
Outpatient Procedure or Covered Service Precertification
Precertification may be required to determine the medical necessity and appropriateness of certain outpatient
procedures or covered services as determined by Highmark prior to the receipt of services.
In-Area Network Care
Network providers are responsible for the precertification of such procedure or covered service and you will not
be financially responsible whenever certification for such procedure or covered service is not obtained by the
network provider. If the procedure or covered service is deemed not to be medically necessary and
appropriate, you will not be financially responsible, except when Highmark provides prior written notice to you
that charges for the procedure or covered service will not be covered. In such case, you will be financially
responsible for such procedure or covered service.
Out-of-Area Care
Whenever you utilize a network provider located out-of-area, it is your responsibility to first contact Highmark to
confirm the medical necessity and appropriateness of such procedure or covered service. If you do not contact
Highmark for certification, that procedure or covered service may be reviewed after it is received to determine
medical necessity and appropriateness. If the procedure or covered service is determined to be medically
necessary and appropriate, benefits will be paid in accordance with the plan. If the procedure or covered
service is determined not to be medically necessary and appropriate, no benefits will be provided. In such case
you will be financially responsible for the full amount of the charge of the network provider located out-of-area.
Out-of-Network Care
Whenever you utilize an out-of-network provider, it is your responsibility to first contact Highmark to confirm the
medical necessity and appropriateness and/or obtain precertification of such procedure or covered service. If
you do not contact Highmark for precertification, that procedure or covered service may be reviewed after it is
received to determine medical necessity and appropriateness. If the procedure or covered service is
determined to be medically necessary and appropriate, benefits will be paid in accordance with the plan. You
will be financially responsible for the difference between what is covered by the plan and the full amount of the
out-of-network provider's charge. If such procedure or covered service is determined not to be medically
necessary and appropriate, no benefits will be provided. In such case, you will be financially responsible for the
full amount of the out-of-network provider's charge.
If you have any questions regarding procedures and services subject to precertification or Highmark's
precertification determination of a procedure or service for medical necessity and appropriateness of certain
CERT-STU-2024
53</page>
    <page number="54">outpatient procedures or covered services, you can contact Highmark via the toll-free Member Service
telephone number located on the back of your ID card or check the member website.
Retrospective Review
Retrospective review may occur when a service or procedure has been rendered without the required
precertification.
Case Management Services
Case Management is a voluntary program in which a case manager, with input from you and your health care
providers, assists when you are facing and/or recovering from a hospital admission, dealing with multiple
medical problems or facing catastrophic needs. Highmark case managers can provide educational support,
assist in coordinating needed health care services, put you in touch with community resources, assist in
addressing obstacles to your recovery such as benefit and caregiver issues and answer your questions.
Individual Case and Care Management
Highmark shall provide such alternative benefits, in its sole discretion, only when, and for so long as, it
determines that the services are medically necessary and appropriate, cost effective, and that the total benefits
paid for such procedures/services do not exceed the total benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled to.
Highmark, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit access and/or modify benefit(s), regardless of the
disease or condition, when Highmark identifies utilization patterns that could potentially result in harm to you or
the public.
You can call and request case management services if you feel you need it by contacting Member Services at
the telephone number listed on the back of your ID card.
Health Improvement Services and Support
From time to time, Highmark may directly or indirectly make available to you information and access to
non-medical items, services and support programs designed to address underlying social and environmental
factors that may negatively impact your health status. The provision of such information, items, services, and
support programs shall not alter the benefits provided under this program.
Selection of Providers
You have the option of choosing where and from whom to receive covered services. You may utilize a network
provider or an out-of-network provider. However, covered services received from a network provider are
usually provided at a higher level of benefits than those received from an out-of-network provider and certain
non-emergency services may only be covered when rendered by a network provider. Please note that benefits
for covered telemedicine services are only provided when such services are rendered by a designated
telemedicine provider.
In the event you require non-emergency covered services that are not available within the network, Highmark
may refer you to an out-of-network provider. You must notify Highmark prior to receiving a covered service
from an out-of-network provider in order for Highmark to facilitate this arrangement. In such cases, services will
be covered at the n etwork level so that you will not be responsible for any greater out-of-pocket amount than if
services had been rendered by a network provider. You will not be responsible for any difference between
Highmark's payment and the out-of-network provider's billed charge.

*YTOCLVL2*Prescription Drug Management*TOCLVL2* our prescription drug program provides the following provisions which will determine the medical necessity
and appropriateness of covered medications and supplies.
Early Refill
Except for the purposes of Medication Synchronization and refills of covered medications that are eyedrops, no
coverage is provided for any refill of a covered medication that is dispensed before your predicted use of at
least 75% of the days' supply of the previously dispensed covered medication, unless your physician obtains
precertification from Highmark for an earlier refill.
Coverage for refills of covered medications shall be provided for any refill dispensed between either:
l twenty-one (21) and thirty (30) days (for 30-day supply);
l forty-two (42) and sixty (60) days (for 60-day supply); or
l sixty-three (63) and ninety (90) days (for 90-day supply)
after the date on which the Member received the original prescription or the most recent refill.
Unexpected Event
If your prescription is lost or stolen due to an event such as a fire or theft, you may be able to get an early
refill. Call Member Service at the number on your member ID card for help. You will need a copy of the
report from the fire department, police department or other agency.
Please note: The early refill authorization does not apply to events that can be controlled, such as spilling
or losing the medicine.
Traveling Abroad
If you will be out of the country when it is time to refill your prescription, call Member Service for help. Be
sure to have your member ID card and your prescription information. Please allow at least five business
days to complete the request.
Individual Case Management
From time to time, Highmark may offer you the opportunity to participate in Prescription Drug care
management programs. These programs are designed to help you maintain good health, manage chronic
conditions or special health care needs and reduce risk factors. Such care management programs may include
the provision of devices or durable medical equipment at no additional cost to you. Participation in select
programs is voluntary and Highmark reserves the right to modify or discontinue any such program at any time.
Highmark, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit access and/or modify benefit(s), regardless of the
disease or condition, when Highmark identifies utilization patterns that could potentially result in harm to you or
the public.
Quantity Level Limits
Quantity level limits may be imposed on certain prescription drugs by Highmark. Such limits are based on the
manufacturer’s recommended daily dosage or as determined by Highmark. Quantity level limits control the
quantity covered each time a new prescription order or refill is dispensed for selected prescription drugs. Each
time a prescription order or refill is dispensed, the pharmacy provider may limit the amount dispensed.
Managed Prescription Drug Coverage
A prescription order or refill which may exceed the manufacturer’s recommended dosage over a specified
period of time may be denied by Highmark when presented to the pharmacy provider. Highmark may contact
CERT-STU-2024
55</page>
    <page number="56">the prescribing physician to determine if the covered medication is medically necessary and appropriate. The
covered medication will be dispensed if it is determined by Highmark to be medically necessary and
appropriate.
Preauthorization
Certain prescription drugs may require preauthorization to ensure the medical necessity and appropriateness
of the prescription order. The prescribing physician must obtain authorization from Highmark prior to
prescribing certain covered medications. The specific drugs or drug classifications which require
preauthorization may be obtained by calling the toll-free Member Service telephone number appearing on your
ID card.

physician will be notified of additional facts or documents needed so that the review can be completed within
the time frame referenced above.
Closely Related Service
There may be circumstances where your provider may perform a closely related service for which
precertification was required but was not obtained. In that case, Highmark may not deny coverage of the
closely related service for failure to obtain precertification if your provider notifies Highmark of the
provided service no later than 3 business days following completion of the closely related service but
before submission of the claim for payment. Your provider’s notification to Highmark must include all
relevant clinical information necessary to evaluate the medical necessity and appropriateness of the
closely related service.

Highmark. Highmark reserves the right to request, at any time, documentation relative to eligibility for coverage
of any individual enrolled for coverage.
You may enroll your:
l Spouse under a legally valid existing marriage
l Children under 26 years of age, unless otherwise extended pursuant to applicable state or federal

service on active duty or active state duty.
For the purposes of this note, full-time student shall mean a dependent who is enrolled in, and regularly
attending, an accredited school, college or university, or a licensed technical or specialized school for 15 or

Covered Students Age 65 or Over
If you are age 65 or over, you will remain covered under the program for the same benefits available to
members under age 65. As a result:

Contact your plan administrator for specific details.
Spouses Age 65 or Over of Students
If you are a student, your spouse has the same choices for benefit coverage as indicated above for the
member age 65 and over.

Termination of Your Coverage Under the Group Insured Contract
*YTOCLVL2*Termination of Your Coverage Under the Group Insured Contract*TOCLVL2* our coverage can be terminated in the following instances:
l When you cease to be a student, the group shall promptly notify Highmark that you are no longer
eligible for coverage and that your coverage should be terminated as follows:
¡ When prompt notification is received, coverage will be terminated no earlier than the date on
which you cease to be eligible.
¡ When a group requests a retroactive termination of coverage, coverage will be terminated no
earlier than the first day of the month preceding the month in which Highmark received notice
from the group.
l When you fail to pay the required contribution, your coverage will terminate at the end of the last
month for which payment was made.
l Termination of the group insured contract automatically terminates the coverage of all the
members. It is the responsibility of the group to notify you of the termination of coverage. However,
coverage will be terminated regardless of whether the notice is given to you by the group.
l If it is proven that you obtained or attempted to obtain benefits or payment for benefits through fraud
or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact, Highmark may, upon 30-day advance written
notice to you, terminate your coverage under the program.

* l TOCLVL2*Benefits after Termination of Coverage*TOCLVL2* If you are an inpatient on the day your coverage terminates, benefits for inpatient covered services will be
continued as follows:
¡ Until the maximum amount of benefits has been paid; or
¡ Until the inpatient stay ends; or
¡ Until you become covered, without limitation as to the condition for which you are receiving
inpatient care, under another group program; whichever occurs first.
l If you are pregnant on the date coverage terminates, no additional coverage will be provided.
l If you are totally disabled at the time your coverage terminates due to termination of being an active
student, medical benefits, excluding outpatient prescription drug benefits, will be continued for covered
services directly related to the condition causing such total disability. This benefit extension does not
apply to covered services relating to other conditions, illnesses, diseases or injuries and is not available if
your termination was due to fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact. This total disability
extension of benefits will be provided as long as you remain so disabled as follows:
¡ Up to a maximum period of 12 consecutive months; or
¡ Until the maximum amount of benefits has been paid; or
¡ Until the total disability ends; or
¡ Until you become covered without limitation as to the disabling condition under other group
coverage, whichever occurs first.
l If you are required to pay any premium, your benefits will not be continued if your coverage is terminated
because you failed to pay the required premium.
l Benefits will also be provided for you who, on the date this coverage terminates and as described in the
Health Care Management, Benefits after Provider Termination from the Network subsection, is in an
active course of treatment until the earlier of such time as that treatment has been completed or for a
period of up to ninety (90) days from the date this coverage terminates.
Coordination of Benefits
*MTOCLVL2*Coordination of Benefits*TOCLVL2* ost health care programs, including your health care program, contain a coordination of benefits provision.
This provision is used when you, your spouse or your covered dependents are eligible for payment under more
than one health care program. The object of coordination of benefits is to ensure that your covered expenses
will be paid, while preventing duplicate benefit payments.
Here is how the coordination of benefits provision works:
l When your other coverage does not mention &quot;coordination of benefits,&quot; then that coverage pays first.
Benefits paid or payable by the other coverage will be taken into account in determining if additional
benefit payments can be made under your program.
l When the person who received care is covered as an employee under one contract, and as a dependent
under another, then the employee coverage pays first.
l When a dependent child is covered under two contracts whose parents are married or are living together,
whether or not they have ever been married, the contract which covers the person as a dependent of the
parent whose birthday (month and day) falls earliest in the calendar year will be primary. But, if both
parents have the same birthday, the program which covered the parent longer will be the primary
program.
l If the dependent child's parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have
ever been married, the following applies:
CERT-STU-2024
62</page>
    <page number="63">¡ if a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the dependent child's health care
expenses or health care coverage, that contract is the primary program;
¡ if a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the dependent child's health care
expenses or health care coverage, the provision for married or living together above shall determine
the order of benefits;
¡ if a court decree states the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has
responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the dependent child, the
provision for married or living together above shall determine the order of benefits; or
¡ if there is no court decree allocating responsibility for the dependent child's health care expenses or
health care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows:
i. the contract covering the custodial parent;
ii. the contract covering the spouse of custodial parent;
iii. the contract covering the non-custodial parent; and then
iv. the contract covering the spouse of the non-custodial parent
l If none of the above circumstances applies, the coverage you have had for the longest time pays first.
If you receive more than you should have when your benefits are coordinated, you will be expected to repay
any overpayment.
Prescription drug benefits are not coordinated against any other health care or drug benefit coverage.
Pediatric vision care benefits are not coordinated against any other health care or vision benefit coverage.

breach to the extent that such failure to perform, delay or default arises out of a cause, existing or future, that is
beyond the reasonable control and not the result of the negligence of Highmark. Such events include, by way
of illustration and not limitation, Acts of God, war (declared or undeclared), government regulation, acts or
inaction of governmental authority, civil or military authority, unforeseen disruptions caused by suppliers,
subcontractors, vendors or carriers, terrorism, disaster, strikes, civil-disorder, curtailment of transportation

*TOCLVL2*Notice of Claim and Proof of Loss*TOCLVL2* (Applies to Post-service Claims Only)
Network Providers have entered into an agreement with Highmark pertaining to the payment for covered
services that they provide to you. When you receive covered services from a network Provider, it is the
responsibility of the network provider to submit its claim to Highmark in accordance with the terms of its
participation agreement. Should the network provider fail to submit its claim in a timely manner or
otherwise satisfy Highmark’s requirements as they relate to the filing of claims, you will not be liable, and
the network provider shall hold you harmless relative to payment of the covered services that you
received.
When covered services are received from other than a network provider, you are responsible for
submitting the claim to Highmark. In such instances, you must submit the claim in accordance with the
following procedures:
Notice of Claim
Highmark will not be liable for any claims unless proper notice is furnished to Highmark that you have
received covered services. Written notice of a claim must be given to Highmark within 20 days or as soon
as reasonably possible after you have received covered services. Notice given by you or on your behalf
to Highmark that includes information sufficient to identify you shall constitute sufficient notice of a claim
to Highmark. You can give notice to Highmark by writing to the Member Service Department. The
address of the Member Service Department can be found on your ID card. A charge shall be considered
incurred on the date you receive the service or supply for which the charge is made.
Claim Forms
Proof of loss for covered services must be submitted to Highmark on the appropriate claim form.
Highmark, upon receipt of a notice of a claim will, within 15 days following the date a notice of a claim is
received, furnish you with claim forms for filing proofs of loss. If claim forms are not furnished within 15
days after the giving of such notice, you shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this
subsection as to filing a proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in this subsection for filing
proofs of loss, itemized bills for covered services as described below. The proof of loss may be submitted
to Highmark at the address appearing on your ID card.
Proof of Loss
Claims cannot be paid until a written proof of loss is submitted to Highmark. Written proof of loss must be
provided to Highmark within 90 days after the date of such loss. Proof of loss must include all data
necessary for Highmark to determine benefits. Failure to submit a proof of loss to Highmark within the
time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if it is shown that the proof of loss was submitted as
soon as reasonably possible, but in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, will Highmark be
required to accept a proof of loss later than 1 year from the time proof is otherwise required.
Submission of Claim Forms
The completed claim form, with all itemized bills attached, must be forwarded to Highmark at the address
appearing on your ID Card to satisfy the requirement of submitting a written proof of loss and to receive
payment for covered services.
To avoid delay in handling claims that you submit, answers to all questions on the claim form must be
complete and correct. Each claim form must be accompanied by itemized bills showing:
Person or organization providing the Service or supply

represented by an attorney or other individual before the Department.
Internal Adverse Benefit Determination Process
Highmark maintains an internal appeal process involving one level of review for adverse benefit
determinations. Adverse benefit determinations include the following:
l a decision by Highmark that, based upon the information provided and utilization review, a request
for a benefit does not meet Highmark’s requirements for medical necessity, appropriateness, health
care setting, level of care or effectiveness or is determined to be experimental or investigational,
such that the requested benefit is therefore denied, reduced or terminated or payment is not
provided or made, in whole or in part, for the benefit;
CERT-STUD-2024
72</page>
    <page number="73">l the denial, reduction, termination or failure to provide or make payment, in whole or in part, for a
benefit based on Highmark’s determination of your eligibility for coverage under your benefit
program or noncompliance with an administrative policy or
l a rescission of coverage determination by Highmark.
An adverse benefit determination does not involve a complaint.
If you receive notice of an adverse benefit determination, you have one hundred-eighty (180) days from the
date of your receipt of notification of the adverse decision to submit an appeal.
Upon receipt of the appeal, Highmark will provide written confirmation to you that the request has been
received, and that Highmark has classified it as an adverse benefit determination for purposes of internal
review.
Upon request to Highmark, you may review all documents, records and other information relevant to your
appeal and shall have the right to submit or present additional evidence or testimony which includes any
written or oral statements, comments and/or remarks, documents, records, information, data or other material
in support of your appeal.
Your appeal will be reviewed by a representative from the Member Grievance and Appeals Department. The
representative shall not have been involved or be the subordinate of any individual that was involved in any
previous decision to deny the claim or matter which is the subject of your appeal. In rendering a decision on
your appeal, the Member Grievance and Appeals Department will take into account all evidence, comments,
testimony, documents, records, and other information submitted by you without regard to whether such
information was previously submitted to or considered by Highmark. The Member Grievance and Appeals
Department will afford no deference to any prior adverse decision on the claim which is the subject of your
appeal.
Each appeal will be promptly evaluated, and Highmark will provide written notification of its decision within the
following time frames:
l When the appeal involves a non-urgent care pre-service claim, within a reasonable period of time
appropriate to the medical circumstances involved not to exceed thirty (30) days following receipt of
the appeal;
l When the appeal involves an urgent care claim, an admission, availability of care, continued stay or
service for which you have received emergency care services but have not been discharged from a
facility, or a determination that a service is experimental/investigative and, based on the written
certification of the treating Provider, would be significantly less effective if not promptly initiated, as
soon as possible taking into account the medical exigencies involved but not later than seventy-two
(72) hours following receipt of the appeal; or
l When the appeal involves a post-service claim, a decision by Highmark to rescind coverage, or for
any other adverse benefit determination not set forth above, within a reasonable period of time not
to exceed thirty (30) days following receipt of the appeal.
If Highmark fails to provide notice of its decision within the above-stated time frames or otherwise fails to
strictly adhere to these appeal procedures, you may be permitted to request an external review and/or pursue
any applicable right to arbitration.
In the event that Highmark renders an adverse decision on the appeal, the notification shall include, among
other items, the specific reason or reasons for the adverse decision including clinical rationale, the procedure
for appealing the decision and a statement regarding your right to pursue legal action.
CERT-STUD-2024

    <page number="74">External Adverse Benefit Determination Process
If you receive an adverse benefit determination, you may appeal such decision to an external entity. The type
of external review is dependent upon the type of adverse benefit determination.
If the adverse benefit determination is an administrative denial, meaning that the adverse decision was based
on:
l Prior authorization, coverage or payment based on a lack of eligibility, failure to submit complete
information or other failure to comply with an administrative policy; or
l is a rescission of coverage,
you must follow the appeal process outlined in the External Appeal of Administrative Denial paragraph below.
If the adverse benefit determination was based on:
l Medical necessity and appropriateness
l Health care setting;
l Level of care;
l Effectiveness of a covered service; or
l Relates to a claim regarding Highmark’s compliance with the surprise billing and cost-sharing
protections under the federal No Surprises Act,
You must follow the appeal process outlined in the External Review of Non-Administrative Denials paragraph
below.
External Appeal of Administrative Denial
You will have fifteen (15) days from the receipt of the notice of Highmark’s adverse decision on the internal
appeal on an administrative denial to appeal the decision to the Department.
All records from the internal process for the administrative denial will be forwarded to the Department in the
manner prescribed. You and Highmark may submit additional material related to the administrative denial to
the Department. You may be represented by an attorney or other individual before the Department.
External Review of Non-Administrative Denials
You shall have four (4) months from the receipt of the notice of an adverse benefit determination of a
non-administrative denial to file a request for an external review of an adverse benefit determination resulting
with the Department. Administrative denials are not eligible for this external review process and must be
appealed as set forth in the External Appeal of Administrative Denial paragraph, above.
Except in the instance of a request for expedited external review, the request for external review should be
filed in writing to the Department. The Department may prescribe the form and content of the external review
request, but the request must include an authorization form authorizing the Plan and provider to disclose
pertinent protected health information to the external review. The request should include the reasons, material
justification and all reasonably necessary supporting information as part of the external review request.
CERT-STUD-2024
74</page>
    <page number="75">Preliminary Review and Notification
Within one (1) business day from receipt of the request for external review, the Department shall send a copy
of the request to Highmark. Within five (5) business days from receipt of the copy of the request for external
review, Highmark will complete a preliminary review of the external review request to determine:
l whether you are or were covered under this program at the time the service which is the subject of
the denied claim was or would have been received;
l whether the service, which is the subject of the denied claim, is not a covered service under this
because it does not meet the Plan’s requirements as to Medical Necessity and Appropriateness,
health care setting, level of care or effectiveness of a Covered Service, or because the Plan
determined the service to be Experimental/Investigative for a particular medical condition;
l with respect to denials based on the experimental and investigational nature of the service, whether
your Provider has certified that: (1) standard health care services have not been effective, are not
medically appropriate or that no alternative covered service is more beneficial than the service that
is the subject of the denial; and (2) that the recommended service is likely to be more than available
standard health care services, or that scientifically valid studies using accepted protocols
demonstrate that the requested service requested is likely to be more beneficial to you than any
available standard health care services;
l whether you have exhausted Highmark's internal appeal process, unless otherwise not required to
exhaust that process; and
l whether you have provided all the information and any applicable forms required to process the
external review request.
Within one (1) business day following completion of its preliminary review of the request, Highmark shall in
writing notify you and the Department of its determination.
In the event that the external review request is not complete, the notification will describe the information or
materials needed to complete the request.
In the event that the external review request is complete but not eligible for external review, notification by
Highmark will include the reasons why the request is ineligible for external review. Highmark’s determination
that the request is not eligible for external review may be appealed to the Department.
Final Review and Notification
Within one (1) business day from receipt of the notification that the request is complete and eligible for external
review, the Department shall assign an independent review organization (IRO) to conduct the external review
and notify Highmark of the assignment. If the request relates to a determination that the treatment is
experimental or investigative, within one (1) business day of receipt of the assignment notification, the IRO
shall select one or more clinical reviewers to conduct the external review. The Department shall notify you that
the request has been accepted and is eligible for external review. The notice will further state that any
additional information which you may have in support of the request must be submitted, in writing, within fifteen
(15) business days for a standard external review request, or within five (5) business days if the external
review relates to an experimental or investigative service, following receipt of the notice.
Any additional information timely submitted by you and received by the assigned IRO will be forwarded to
Highmark within one (1) business day of receipt. Upon receipt of the information, Highmark shall be permitted
an opportunity to reconsider its prior decision regarding the claim that was denied or the matter which is the
subject of the external review request. Reconsideration by Highmark of its prior decision may not delay or
terminate the external review. The external review may be terminated without a determination by the IRO only
if Highmark reverses its prior decision and provides coverage or payment for the claim that is the subject of the
external review. Within one (1) business day of making the decision to reverse its prior determination,
CERT-STUD-2024
75</page>
    <page number="76">Highmark shall notify the Department, the assigned IRO and you, in writing, of its decision. Upon receipt of
such notice, the assigned IRO shall terminate the external review.
The assigned IRO or clinical reviewer will review all information and documents that it timely received and

appeal process are not binding on the IRO or clinical reviewer. The assigned IRO shall provide written notice of
the final external review decision to the Department, Highmark and you within forty-five (45) days from receipt
by the IRO of the external review request. Written notice of the decision shall provide, among other
information, a statement of the principal reasons for the decision including the rationale and standards relied
upon by the IRO. Upon receipt of notice that Highmark’s decision was reversed by the IRO, Highmark shall
within twenty-four (24) hours approve coverage of the service that was the subject of the external review
request.
Expedited External Review

l an urgent care claim;
l an admission, availability of care, continued stay or service for which you received emergency care
services but have not been discharged from a facility; or
l a determination the service is experimental or investigational and, based on the written certification
of the treating Provider, would be significantly less effective if not promptly initiated,

be provided for retrospective adverse benefit determinations.
A request for an expedited external review must be submitted to the Department. Upon receipt of a request for
an expedited external review, the Department shall, within twenty-four (24) hours, send a copy of the request

required, the IRO must notify you within twenty-four (24) hours. Additionally, Highmark may agree to waive the
expedited internal review exhaustion requirement.

expedited external review, the Department shall assign an IRO to conduct the external review and notify
Highmark of the assignment. Upon receipt of the notification of the IRO assignment, Highmark shall transmit
documents and information considered in making the adverse benefit determination to the assigned IRO in an
expeditious manner. Decisions or conclusions reached during Highmark's determination or Highmark's Internal
Adverse Benefit Determination Process are not binding on the IRO. The assigned IRO will conduct the review
and provide notice of its final external review decision as expeditiously as your medical condition or
circumstances require, but in no event more than seventy-two (72) hours following receipt by the IRO of the
request for expedited external review. If notice of the decision by the IRO is not provided in writing, the IRO
must provide within forty-eight (48) hours following initial notice of its final external review decision, written
confirmation of that decision to Highmark, you, and the Department. Written notice of the decision shall
