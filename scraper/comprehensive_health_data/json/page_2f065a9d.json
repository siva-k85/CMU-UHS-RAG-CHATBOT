Enrollments and waivers do not carry over from the previous academic year.\nTo qualify for a waiver, students must verify that they have active medical insurance that meets\nuniversity requirements\n.\nAll insurance plans must be active for the\nduration of your time\nas an enrolled student.\nStudents (and families where applicable) are responsible for reviewing these requirements and verifying that their medical insurance meets them.\nPart-time students\nwho wish to waive SHIP only need to provide proof of active insurance. The insurance plan does not need to meet all university requirements for a waiver.\nStudy Abroad students\nshould refer to our\nstudy abroad section\nfor additional waiver details.\nWaiver applications must be submitted by the student, through the insurance portal in SIO, prior to a student's Open Enrollment deadline.\nIf approved, the student insurance charge will be credited back to the student's account. With an approved waiver, a student accepts full financial liability for any medical costs incurred. If a waiver is not approved (because the plan does not meet\nuniversity requirements)\n, the student must enroll in the CMU student medical insurance plan.\nLate Waiver Period & Waiver Appeals\nLate waiver applications will be accepted for two weeks after a student's Open Enrollment deadline, and are subject to a $50 late fee.\nStudents who have extenuating circumstances and wish to request a waiver beyond the two-week late period must submit a formal appeal. Submitting an\nappeal\ndoes not guarantee that a waiver will be approved, but does allow a student's circumstances to be considered. If an appeal is granted and the waiver is approved,\nthe student will be responsible for paying the student medical plan premium for the months of enrollment.\nWaiver appeals are not accepted after 90 days from a student's Open Enrollment deadline.\nContact the Student Health Insurance Team\nfor late waiver requests and appeals.\nJul 1 -\nAug 22\nFall Open Enrollment: for all new and returning CMU students\nHow to Apply for a Waiver\nDuring Open Enrollment: log into SIO > Campus Life > Health Insurance\nClick the enroll/waive portal link\nChoose the option to waive\nFill out your details and upload the front and back\nof your current medical insurance card\nClick CONFIRM on the final screen to submit\nInsurance Waiver Requirements\nIn order to waive CMU's Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), all full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. must have health insurance that meets the following requirements:\nis provided by a company licensed to do business in the United States, with a U.S. claims payment office and a U.S. phone number;\nhas unlimited annual and lifetime benefits (i.e., no policy maximum);\nwill be in force for the\nduration of your time\nas a student for the academic year/semester (whichever applies);\nhas a maximum deductible of $5,000 individual/$10,000 family.
