Information about Flu
Most experts believe that flu viruses spread person to person, mainly by tiny droplets made with people with the flu cough, sneeze, or talk.
If you have cold and flu symptoms, please schedule with Tartan Testing, a local pharmacy, or UHS to get screened for COVID-19.
If you are negative for COVID, it is possible you have the flu or a cold.
You do not need to be tested for flu, but please stay home and isolate to reduce spreading to others, until 24 hours without a fever.
You do not have to be seen by a medical provider for the flu unless you are severely ill or short of breath.
Please wear a facial covering around others until you are symptom free.
Wash your hands often to keep from spreading flu to others.
Drink lots of fluids and take acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed for pain and/or fever.
If it is less than two days since youâ€™ve been sick and high risk, please call UHS to ask about taking anti-viral medications.
Feel free to call UHS nurses to ask for advice (412-268-2157, option 2).
Learn more about the flu on the CDC website.
