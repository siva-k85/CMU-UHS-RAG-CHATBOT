      <paragraph>New fall semester students must enroll in or waive the CMU SHIP between July 1 - Aug. 22, for coverage from Aug. 1, 2025 - July 31, 2026.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Learn more about Open Enrollment</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Health insurance is vital to ensuring access to care and predictable health care costs, as well as aiding students in the achievement of their personal and academic goals. That is why all full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. are required to meet CMU's health insurance mandate each academic year.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>To fulfill this mandate students must have insurance that meets university requirements for the duration of their time as an enrolled student, either through enrolling in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), or obtaining a SHIP waiver:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>SHIP Eligibility</paragraph>
      <paragraph>All full-time and part-time degree-seeking Carnegie Mellon students, and their eligible dependents, are eligible to enroll in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) during their Open Enrollment period.  Students can also enroll in the SHIP, or add eligible dependents to their existing SHIP enrollments, outside of Open Enrollment due to a Qualifying Life Event (QLE).</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Open Enrollment is the period during which students must enroll in the CMU SHIP or apply to waive it. SHIP enrollments, and waiver applications, are submitted through the insurance portal in Student Information Online (SIO).</paragraph>
      <paragraph>How to submit and enrollment/waiver during Open Enrollment</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Students who do not take any action to enroll in, or waive, the CMU SHIP during their Open Enrollment period will be auto-enrolled into the CMU SHIP medical plan.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>We strongly recommend that students do not wait to be auto-enrolled:</paragraph>
