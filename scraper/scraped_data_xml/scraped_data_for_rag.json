Collaborating with the greater university community affords a trainee exposure to the multidisciplinary aspects of working in a university counseling center. CaPS provides comprehensive psychological services to the campus community; both graduate and undergraduate students receive services through CaPS. While direct clinical service is a significant focus of CaPS, the center also provides other services to the university community including consultation and outreach programming.\n\nA counseling or social work internship at CaPS would entail a range of experiences working with our Triage and Case Management clinicians. These training opportunities can include but are not limited to: crisis intervention (phone and walk-in appointments), initial phone screening consultation/triage, case management of complex clinical situations, community referrals and collaboration, coordination with the university-at-large, and participation in outreach events. Weekly supervision would be provided by the Triage and Case Management clinicians.\n\nIn order to experience a more in-depth training opportunity, it is requested that applicants commit to a two-semester internship with CaPS. The internship experience is August-May.\n\nThe application for Master's Level internship program for the 2025-2026 academic year is open and due on February 15th. This is for a fall/spring two commitment internship experience. To apply, please email current CV and resume to Krissy Cannata, LCSW, CCaRS Training coordinator at kcannata@cmu.edu.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsiblity\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Professional Training\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• Â© 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• Get Support\n    \n\n                      Support For Yourself\n    \n\n                      For Someone Else\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n• Services\n    \n\n                      Gender Affirming Care\n    \n\n                      Let's Talk\n    \n\n                      Consultation\n    \n\n                      Groups & Skills Clinics\n    \n\n                      Individual Therapy\n    \n\n                      Outreach Prevention & Education\n    \n\n                      Psychiatric Care\n    \n\n                      Referrals\n    \n\n                      Tele-Mental Health\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n• TimelyCare\n• Resources\n• Professional Training\n• Get Involved\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n    \n\n                      Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Contact CaPS\n• About CaPS\n    \n\n                      Frequently Asked Questions\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• CaPS Event D-List Sign Up\n\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2922\nEmail: kcannata@cmu.edu",

It’s a conscious, self-directed and evolving process, meaning you will always be working to create a fulfilling life. It involves identifying and living out our values in everyday practice, while being connected to a supportive community. The absence of illness or disease does not confirm our wellness, nor does any singular milestone or success. In addition, well-being also means holding what’s happening in our broader culture and recognizing the impact and implications it has on us and our community. We cannot be well when our community is not well.\n\nHolistic well-being as a state is similar to our learning; we are never finished and there are always new ways to grow, to understand, and to change.\n\nThe process of clarifying our values and developing our understanding of our life’s meaning in the world is an essential part of one’s spiritual life and growth. In common usage, we often assume that spirituality language is reserved for a person’s commitment to, participation in, or struggle with established religious organizations and practices.\n\nHowever, in the last 20 years, researchers from a national study on Spirituality and Higher Education conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute in California articulated that spirituality includes development of:\n\nHarsh Agarwal\n\nHarsh (he/him) joined CMU as a Program Specialist for the Wellness Initiatives in September 2023.

Prior to joining CMU, he was a program manager with Teach For India, where he trained and coached thirty teachers to provide quality education to more than 500 children in public schools in India. Harsh is passionate about mindfulness, human flourishing, and holistic wellbeing and is committed to collective leadership. Harsh enjoys nature walks, improv comedy, and group meditations.\n\nAngie Lusk\n\nAngie (she/her) has been working with the CMU community since 2008, supporting the creation of CMU’s Mindfulness Room in 2013 and the pet therapy program in 2014 that showcase the value of collaborating with student leaders to create positive change on campus. With more than 20 years of experience in higher education, she prioritizes work that supports individual and collective positive change, which starts by identifying values and then aligning them to everyday practice. She has a particular interest in growing a mindfulness movement at Carnegie Mellon and in Pittsburgh that cultivates a lens of curiosity, compassion, and connectedness.\n\nJennifer McCurry\n\nJennifer (she/her) became CMU’s coordinator of Religious and Spiritual Life in winter 2024. She has a bachelor of arts from Dartmouth College, a masters of divinity from Duke Divinity School, and a Certificate of Executive Leadership from Princeton Theological Seminary. An ordained pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, she has previously served as the coordinator of spiritual life at Point Park University, an interfaith chaplain in both homeless shelter and hospital contexts, and a pastor in a diverse series of congregations.

      "content": "Do the people you are intimate with…\n✔✔Ask what you want when it comes to sex and respect your\nboundaries? Most sexual assaults are committed by someone\nthe survivor knows. No one should pressure or force you into\ndoing anything sexual or harm you physically.\n✔✔Support your independence and interests? No one should\nkeep you from your social life, work, or educational goals.\nSex should feel good for all partners and healthy\nrelationships are ones that are supportive.\nBut what about when our boundaries are not respected?\nYou are not alone\nSexual assault and dating violence are not OK, but they are\ncommon. If you or someone you know has experienced an\nassault or abuse, support is available.\nConnect with an advocate: For confidential\ncounseling, safety planning, support groups,\nreporting options, and legal advocacy.\nVisit your campus health center or local health\nprovider: For mental health support, STI/HIV\ntesting and treatment (including PrEP/PEP), info\non emergency contraception (the morning after\npill/Plan B) to prevent pregnancy, and more.\nKnow your Title IX office: If you decide to report,\nthis office investigates sexual violence and sexual\nharassment. Be aware that some school staff,\nprofessors, RAs, coaches, etc. may be required\nto notify the Title IX office if they hear about an\nincident.\nNo matter who caused the harm - a friend, date, partner,\nclassmate, or someone at a party - survivors are often made\nto feel like what happened was their fault or not a big deal.\nIt is never a survivor’s fault and their experiences are valid.\nTalking to someone you trust can be a first step in healing.\nYou don’t have to go through this alone.\nYour health and wellness\n✔✔Do you often feel depressed or anxious?\n✔✔Are you drinking, smoking, or using drugs more to cope?\n✔✔Have you noticed changes in your appetite or sleep habits?\n✔✔Has getting to class, finishing school work, or participating\nin other activities been more difficult than usual?\n✔✔Do you ever think about hurting yourself?\nReactions like these are common for people who have\nexperienced sexual/dating violence. It could be helpful to talk\nto a health provider or an advocate about what is going on.\nHelping a friend\nListen and don’t judge. Sexual assault and dating\nviolence can make a survivor feel powerless and alone.\n“You are not alone and nothing you did or didn’t do\ncaused this to happen. I am here for you - what can I\ndo to help?”\nDon’t pressure them to take steps they aren’t ready for\nor don’t want to do. Call the hotlines on this card or\nseek out a confidential resource on campus for more\ntips on how to support a friend.\n\nCulture of consent\nHow can everyone on campus promote a culture of consent,\nsupport survivors, and hold those who use violence or\ncoercion accountable?\nConsent is an active, voluntary agreement that can be\nrevoked at any time.\n✔✔Even if you have had sex with someone before, it’s still\nimportant to ask for consent every time. Over half of sexual\nassaults occur within ongoing relationships.\n✔✔If a person is drunk, high, asleep, or too afraid to say no,\nthey can’t give consent.\nTake action!\n✔✔Lead by example: “Can I kiss you?” Always ask for\nconsent before kissing or touching. Ask them how\nthey feel and respect their answer, even if it means\nyou might not get what you want.\n✔✔Be an active bystander: When you see something\nthat doesn’t seem right, speak up! It can be as simple\nas calling out rape jokes/harassment, or stepping in\nif someone looks like they’re trying to hook up with\nsomeone who is too drunk to give consent.\n✔✔Get involved: Advocate with your administration\nand student government for survivor-centered\npolicies and prevention programs.\n✔✔Challenge gender norms: Harmful gender norms --\nlike assuming men always want sex, thinking LGBQ\npeople don’t experience abuse, believing women\nare “asking for it,” or ignoring trans and gender\nnon-binary identities -- contribute to sexual/dating\nviolence.\nInformation on changing campus culture:\nKnow Your IX End Rape on Campus\nknowyourix.org endrapeoncampus.org\nConfidential hotlines can connect To find out where\nyou to local resources and provide to get emergency\nsupport via phone, text, and chat: contraception:\nbedsider.org/clinics/ec\nNational Sexual Assault Hotline\n24/7 | 1-800-656-4673 | rainn.org\nInfo on HIV prevention:\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline pleaseprepme.org\n24/7 | 1-800-799-7233 | thehotline.org\nLGBT National Talkline\nM-F 1-9pm PT, Sat 9am-2pm PT\n1-800-246-7743 | glbthotline.org\n©2018 Futures Without Violence.

Together we can facilitate an understanding of self, others and the community around us.\n\nOriginally designed by Syracuse University, specifically for a college/university community, Pathways for Suicide Prevention Training is an experiential training focused on enhancing a person’s knowledge, awareness, and skills concerning college student suicide. Emphasis is placed on developing empathic listening skills, communication skills, and the ability to ask students compassionately and directly about their suicidal thoughts. This training employs a multicultural framework and seeks to enhance understanding of and ability to respond to students from numerous intersecting identities.Pathways for Suicide Prevention Training is a three-hour, interactive training program, which will include:\n\nSpring 2025 Training Dates:There are no more training dates available for Spring 2025.

You will build skills you need to reach out and provide initial support to those who are struggling. You will also learn how to connect them to the appropriate support.  This training is offered in collaboration with Health Promotions and Student Support Resources.\n\nSpring 2025 Training Dates:There are no more training dates available for Spring 2025.

We can also help by tailoring a training or workshop to fit the needs of your department or group.\n\nPlease submit a programming request at least two weeks prior to your event date. If we cannot meet your request, we can likely be helpful in exploring alternative options.Examples of Trainings we have done in the past are:\n\nThis is a 90-minute faculty-designed, professional development opportunity that is meant to serve as a broad overview of how best to aid students at Carnegie Mellon University.

The condom will\nexpand naturally and you may not feel it.\nBe sure condom is not twisted. The thin, outer ring should remain\noutside of the body.\nGuide penis or toy into opening of the condom.

      "content": "Carnegie Mellon University Health Services\nHealth Care Power of Attorney (POA) and Confidentiality\nIs medical treatment at UHS confidential? The Family Educational and Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) as\nwell as state laws and professional and ethical codes preclude University Health Services from routinely\nsharing your medical information and counseling records with third parties, including your parents,\nwithout your written consent. However, in a health care emergency where you are incapacitated or\notherwise unable to advocate for yourself, UHS will notify your emergency contact if necessary,\nregardless of whether or not you have a health care power of attorney.\nWhat is a Health Care Power of Attorney? A Health Care Power of Attorney (also known as an Advance\nHealth Care Directive) is a document that designates someone to make health care decisions on your\nbehalf if you become incapacitated.\nWhat is an emergency contact? An emergency contact is someone you designate in writing to be\nnotified about you if there’s an emergency. The CMU Student Information System has a record of your\nemergency contact.\nAre they the same thing? An emergency contact does not automatically have the power to make health\ncare decisions for you. You can make the same person your emergency contact and your health care\ndecision-maker. If they are not the same person, you should give your emergency contact a copy of your\nhealth care POA.\nWhat happens in a health care emergency? If you are at UHS during a health care emergency, you will\nbe asked to contact your emergency contact if you are able to. If you are incapacitated or otherwise\nunable to advocate for yourself, UHS will attempt to notify your emergency contact. UHS does not\nprovide treatment for incapacitating conditions and would transfer you to a hospital. Hospitals will\nfollow their own notification protocols.\nIf I give UHS a copy of my health care POA, what will UHS do with it?\nUHS will store your health care POA with your file.\nDoes UHS automatically provide hospitals with my POA?\nNo. It is your responsibility to keep the health care POA available if you need to go to the hospital. If the\nUHS is sending you to the hospital during regular hours of operation, however, and you are\nincapacitated or unable to advocate for yourself, UHS will contact your emergency contact and make\nevery effort to supply a copy of your health care POA to the hospital/ ambulance technicians.\n\n",

Am I enrolled in the SHIP?\n\n[H2] Additional Common Questions\n\n[H2] I need my insurance ID card. Where can I find my insurance information?\n\n[H2] I do not have a U.S. mailing address yet. Can I enroll in the SHIP?\n\n[H2] If I am graduating in December, can I enroll in the SHIP for August - December only?  Can I enroll only for the months I am on campus?\n\n[H2] I no longer want my student insurance plan/s. Can I cancel the SHIP?\n\n[H2] Outside of Open Enrollment, can I enroll in the medical, dental or vision plans? What if I want to add or remove someone from my plan?\n\n[H2] How do I find in-network health care providers? What if I need to see a doctor or fill a prescription while I am away from campus?\n\n[H2] I am graduating in August. Can I enroll in the SHIP for only the month of August?\n\n[H2] Can I extend the SHIP after graduating in May?\n\n[H2] Why did Highmark send me a letter asking for my Social Security or Tax ID number?\n\n[H3] Mental Health Providers:\n\n[H3] Medical Coverage While Abroad:\n\nSHIP enrollment or waiver status:\n\nQuestions about SHIP coverage (medical procedures, medication, etc.):\n\nQuestions about insurance fees on your student account:\n\nTo update your name, gender, birthdate or mailing address with Highmark:\n\nDepending on the treatment you received, you may have a copay and/or an amount not covered by the insurance plan. The bill from the medical provider will show the charges for the treatment, what your insurance plan has paid and what you owe.\n\nTo start, it is helpful to review the SHIP's Medical Plan Coverage Table, as well as some common insurance terms, in order to better understand what services are covered under the plan.  It is also important to register with Highmark where you can track your medical claims and access your Explanations of Benefits (EOB). The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.\n\nUniversity Health Services (UHS) Charges:\n\nIf you are enrolled in the SHIP and receive care at University Health Services (UHS), many of the fees for our services will be covered by the plan.  If you do owe any fees, those charges will be posted to your student account.\n\nBills from off-campus providers:\n\nIf you see a provider or have a hospital visit outside of UHS, you may receive a bill for non-covered services, and/or copays:\n\nLaboratory Testing:\n\nBills for Ambulance Transport:\n\nThe SHIP covers the cost of emergency ambulance transports, however students are responsible for paying the transport company directly. Highmark will mail you a check for the amount of the transport, once it arrives you have two options:\n\nIf you receive a medical bill and still need assistance, please message the Student Health Insurance Team through HealthConnect, and include a copy of your bill and Explanation of Benefits, if available.\n\nWisdom teeth (third molar) removal is covered under the SHIP Dental Plan and Medical Plan. However, coverage will depend on whether your teeth are soft tissue impacted, or bony impacted.\n\nDental Plan Coverage:\n\nThe SHIP Dental Plan provides benefits for both bony impacted, and soft tissue impacted, wisdom teeth:\n\nYou can review the coverage for third molar removal on the summary of benefits and coverage, located on page 27 of the dental plan book.\n\nMedical Plan Coverage:\n\nThe SHIP Medical Plan only provides benefits for impacted wisdom teeth when partially or totally covered by bone:\n\nYou can review the coverage for third molar removal on page 26 of the medical plan book.\n\nEvaluations & Procedures\n\nBefore having your wisdom teeth removed, you will need to be evaluated. If you have both the SHIP dental plan and medical plan you can get an evaluation from a dentist, or oral surgeon.\n\nThe CMU Medical SHIP provides dental and vision services for students, and their eligible dependents, under the age of 19. This coverage is seperate from the optional dental and vision plans.\n\nPediatric Dental Benefits\n\nPediatric Vision Benefits\n\nClaim forms can be found in the Highmark forms library. Once you have selected the proper form, click the Tips icon for instructions on how to file the claim.\n\nYou can track your claims on your Highmark portal, or call Highmark Member Services with any claim related questions: 800-241-5704.\n\nIf you have the SHIP, prescription drugs are covered, with a copay, at in-network pharmacies. However, prescription drug costs vary according to the drug type (generic, brand-name and specialty), and their corresponding tier levels (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.). Lower tiers (generic) usually have lower copays, while higher tiers (brand-name and specialty) have higher copays.\n\nEnrollments and waivers do not carry over from one academic year to the next; completing Open Enrollment is an annual requirement. Students must enroll in, or waive, the CMU SHIP every academic year that they are enrolled at the university.\n\nAt the start of each academic year, all full-time students (and some part-time students) enrolled in a degree-seeking program are assessed a placeholder charge for the CMU Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). This placeholder charge remains on a student's account until they complete Open Enrollment.\n\nIf you do not complete Open Enrollment, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU Medical SHIP and the insurance fee will remain on your student account.\n\nIf you receive an approved waiver, the insurance fee will be credited back to your student account.\n\nPlease note that invoices are generated on the first day of each month. Please check the Account Activity page in SIO for up-to-date charges and credits.\n\nStudent account or invoice questions should be directed to Student Financial Services.\n\nNo, the insurance fee posted on a student's account is a placeholder charge, and paying the insurance fee does not complete your SHIP enrollment.\n\nStudents must submit a SHIP enrollment during their Open Enrollment period:\n\nInsurance ID cards should arrive 2-3 weeks after your enrollment has been processed. If you are need of your member ID number before your card arrives:\n\nA U.S. mailing address is required to enroll in the CMU SHIP. Enrollments submitted with a non-U.S. address, or an incomplete address, will not be processed.\n\nInternational students enrolling in the CMU SHIP should wait until they have secured a U.S. mailing address where they can receive mail before submitting an enrollment. Waiting until later in the Open Enrollment period to enroll in the SHIP will not affect the coverage dates. SHIP coverage begins on August 1 each academic year, even if you do not submit your enrollment until the end of the Open Enrollment period.\n\nThe CMU SHIP is a full year plan with a coverage period of August 1 - July 31 each academic year. Students entering CMU in the Fall are enrolled and charged for the full coverage year.\n\nStudents graduating in December can request to cancel the SHIP at that time; it does not cancel automatically. Students with an approved cancellation will receive a prorated refund of the remaining months' premiums on the medical, dental and/or vision plans (with adjustment for any PhD student insurance support, if applicable). SHIP cancellations are effective from the first of the month following the month in which the cancellation form is received.\n\nThe final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31, for an April 1 cancellation.  May, June and July cancellations are not permitted.\n\nIf you are graduating in December and would like to cancel your insurance plan, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.\n\nCancellations are only available under the following circumstances:\n\nDecember Graduation (or September certification for doctoral students graduating in December)\n\nFormal separation from CMU (i.e. leave of absence, withdrawal, suspension, forfeit)\n\nFall semester foreign exchange students returning to their university after the fall semester\n\nEnrollment in Medicaid in the state in which you are studying (e.g., a Pittsburgh campus student approved for enrollment into PA Medicaid). Enrollment is based on eligibility and the application process can be lengthy. Students must also have applied for Medicaid before or during their open enrollment period. Locate PA state information.\n\nThe option to join a new plan does not make a student eligible to cancel their current insurance enrollment.\n\nIf you meet this criterion, email UHS when your university enrollment status has been updated to reflect one of the statuses listed above (or when you wish to remove a dependent or have been approved for Medicaid) and we can assist you. You may be eligible to receive a pro-rated refund for the remaining months' premiums.\n\nThe final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31 and the insurance plan cannot be canceled after April 1 (May, June and July cancellations are not permitted).\n\nYou can only enroll in the SHIP outside of your Open Enrollment period if you have had a qualifying life event (for example, involuntary loss of insurance, including due to turning age 26). This applies to the student medical, dental and vision plans; you cannot add the dental or vision plan outside of Open Enrollment without a qualifying event.\n\nIf you are already enrolled in a SHIP plan, you can add dependents who have had a qualifying life event (for example, birth/adoption of a child or arrival to the U.S. for the first time during the coverage year).\n\nYou have 90 days from the qualifying life event into enroll in the SHIP medical, dental or vision plan. You will also need to provide supporting documentation .\n\nRemoving Dependents:\n\nDependents can be removed from your insurance plan at any time before March 31 of the coverage year.\n\nTo make any of these changes, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.\n\nThe CMU SHIP is a national plan, with participating in-network providers in every state.

If you are enrolled in the SHIP, there are a few options for locating services in your area:\n\nCMU SHIP (medical plan) members have access to the same health coverage benefits while abroad as they do while in the U.S. through BCBS Global Core, along with 24 hour emergency medical and travel assistance through the AXA Travel Assistance Program.\n\nYes. Students graduating in August are eligible to enroll in the medical SHIP for the month of August only. August-only enrollments are only available for the student medical plan; dental and vision plans are not available.\n\nIf you are in need of an August-only enrollment, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.\n\nStudents graduating in May are not eligible to extend their SHIP.  Your SHIP enrollment will terminate on August 1.\n\nStudents graduating in August are eligible to enroll in the SHIP for the month of August only.

Building on that foundation, the CuRB curriculum was developed in response to a need for evolving our existing bystander intervention program to be more responsive to how power, bias, and privilege impact our ability to support others. After holding pilot sessions with students, staff and faculty throughout 2023, CuRB is now live and available to the CMU community for those interested in bystander intervention training.\n\nThe CuRB training covers how identity, power, and privilege impacts our role as bystanders and provides space to explore how we arrive at our understandings and perceptions of others. This focus on group reflection and discussion sets the stage for collaboratively unlearning harmful biases that might negatively impact our ability to help loved ones or community members experiencing power-based personal violence. Through open discussion, scenario exercises and actionable tools, CuRB empowers participants to intercept different forms of harm and provide culturally responsive and person-centered support.\n\nA People's History and Response to Sexual Violence\n\nDisability Justice On Campus: Non-Carceral Approaches to Policing and Bystander Intervention\n\nCuRB has two session options: a 5 hour session and a 1.5 hour session. We can come to your student group, department, or residence hall! For groups of 10 or more, we can accommodate special requests for virtual and in-person programs.\n\nThere are two CuRB training options: one full length 5 hour session and another 1.5 hour session. Each version of CuRB centers identity and power and provides opportunity for participants to practice skills. Although both trainings offer opportunities for participants to practice, share with the group and engage with the material, the full length training features more space for discussion and scenario practice. While the 1.5 hour session doesn't offer as much room for open discussion, participants still have the opportunity to share their thoughts with others and practice key skills.\n\nWondering which session is the right one for your group?

CaPS is a voluntary, confidential counseling support for currently enrolled students.\n\nCaPS offers distance counseling via face-to-face video conferencing to currently enrolled CaPS students who meet the eligibility criteria for distance counseling services. Due to licensing laws, CaPS counselors may only provide ongoing therapy to those who are currently in the state of PA. Additionally, this service is available to clients assessed as being appropriate for this form of counseling. If a student is not eligible for this form of counseling, CaPS counselors will provide support and referrals to appropriate services.\n\nIn order to set up services with CaPS, please call 412-268-2922 to schedule an initial consultation appointment. You will choose a password for all future sessions, and will enter this into Zoom Healthcare to enter the meeting. This process protects you from another person posing as you. You will be provided an email confirming your appointment with directions to review and sign the informed consent for telehealth services. The initial consultation will be virtual via Zoom and will be an opportunity for a clinician to get a good understanding of your needs and connect you with the most appropriate supports. This may be telehealth therapy or a more appropriate service. If telehealth therapy at CaPS is identified, you will be connected with an appropriate CaPS therapist.\n\nIt is important to note that video communication may lack some visual or audio cues that on occasion may result in misunderstanding. This can be limited to a degree by using a stationary device such as a laptop or large tablet and remaining in the same room for your sessions. Should misunderstandings happen, it is important to assume that your counselor has positive regard for you, and to check out your assumptions with your counselor. This will reduce any unnecessary feelings of discomfort.\n\nVideo conferencing counseling sessions are held via Zoom Healthcare, a secure and confidential video conferencing platform. You will sign in with your Zoom app, but the therapist’s Zoom makes it more secure and confidential. It is recommended that you sign on to your account at least 5 minutes prior to your session start time. You are responsible for initiating the connection with CaPS via the provided software link and your identified password at the time of your session.\n\nDistance counseling should not be viewed as a substitute for face-to-face counseling or medication by a physician. It is an alternative form of counseling with some differences from traditional counseling. For example:\n\nSo that CaPS is able to get you help in the case of an emergency and for your safety, the following measures are important and necessary:\n\nCaPS provides services for all eligible students, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or veteran status. If it is determined by the clinical staff that an individual’s needs exceed the scope of service or expertise available at CaPS or that your needs cannot be adequately met by participating in distance counseling, we will assist you to identify an appropriate referral to meet your needs. CaPS does not pay the costs of therapy or community resources/treatment services to which you may be referred.\n\nConfidentiality is essential to your counseling progress. Our counselors are therapists who are ethically and legally bound to maintain your confidentiality. A written and/or electronic record (date, time, nature of meeting) of your contacts with CaPS will be maintained in a secure manner.\n\nVideo conferencing sessions in our office are provided behind a closed door. All video conferencing correspondences will be done through Zoom Healthcare, which is encrypted to the federal standard.\n\nTo schedule a pre-screening consultation appointment or for questions give us a call at 412-268-2922. For more information about our services and for additional resources https://www.cmu.edu/counseling/\n\nCaPS recommends that you (the client) are aware of and use safety measures for keeping your PHI (Personal Health Information) confidential, including but not limited to the following suggestions.\n\nPaper\n\nIt is recommended that you store all paper documents with your PHI in a locked cabinet.\n\nWhen participating in distance counseling it is also recommended that you:\n\nAdditional Technology Recommendations:\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• Due to the use of technology, video counseling may have disruptions in service and quality of service.\n• If you are having a crisis, acute psychosis, or suicidal or homicidal thoughts, video counseling might not be appropriate for you needs.\n\n• Your counselor will need to know the location/address in which you will consistently be during counseling sessions, and will need to know if this location changes.\n• Your counselor will request that you identify someone, whom you trust, to give your counselor permission to contact should a situation occur that your counselor believes you to be at risk. You, and/or your counselor, will verify that this emergency contact person is able and willing to go to your location in the event of an emergency, and if your counselor deems necessary, call 911 and/or transport you to a hospital. You will also provide the name/location of the nearest Hospital Emergency Room.\n\n• The most reliable backup is a phone. Therefore, it is recommended that you always have a phone available, and that you provide your counselor with your phone number.\n• If you get disconnected from a video conferencing session, re-start the session. If you are unable to reconnect within ten minutes, please call your counselor.\n\n• Conduct the sessions in a private location where others cannot hear you.\n• Use secure video conferencing technology.

For additional information, please contact Shane Chaplin, Ph.D.\n\nCarnegie Mellon's Counseling and Psychological Services Center (CaPS) operates within the Division of Student Affairs in a university setting which offers support for students beyond that of the counseling center. Collaborating with the greater university community affords a trainee exposure to the multidisciplinary aspects of working in a university counseling center. CaPS provides comprehensive psychological services to the campus community; both graduate and undergraduate students receive services through CaPS. While direct clinical service is a significant focus of CaPS, the counseling center also provides other services to the university community, including consultation and outreach programming.\n\nCarnegie Mellon is a global research university with more than 15,000 students and 6,000 faculty and staff. Recognized for its world-class arts and technology programs, collaboration across disciplines, and innovative leadership of education in the fields of Business Administration, Computer Science, Engineering, Fine Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, Public Policy & Information Systems, and Science, Carnegie Mellon is consistently ranked among the top 25 universities in the United States.\n\nCarnegie Mellon is situated in the heart of Pittsburgh, a city that has reinvented itself as a hub of innovation and information and life sciences technology. Find out why Pittsburgh has been continually ranked as one of America's most liveable cities.\n\nThe doctoral psychology internship for Health Service Providers program is designed to allow the doctoral interns in psychology to experience a university counseling center at its full breadth.  This includes clinical and support services provided by a typical university counseling center. Clinical services include intake evaluations, psychotherapy, group therapy, crisis/triage counseling, consultation, and case management. In addition to their clinical services, interns gain experiences in designing workshops for outreach programming and providing clinical supervision, and there may be opportunities to participate in other projects (e.g., an administrative research opportunity).  During the academic year, up to 50% of a typical week is dedicated to clinical and direct services; this will decrease during academic breaks and the summer months.\n\nThe CMU CaPS doctoral internship in health service psychology is accredited by the American Psychological Association. Inquiries regarding the accreditation of our internship training program may be directed to:\n\nAPA Office of Program Consultation and Accreditation750 First Street, NE • Washington, DC • 20002-4242Phone: 202-336-5979\n\nThe Office of Accreditation’s web address may be accessed here: www.apa.org/ed/accreditation. You may also email the Accreditation Office at apaaccre@apa.org.\n\nCaPS offers a range of support, seminars and professional development activities throughout the training year. In addition to two hours of individual supervision, one hour of supervision focus on crisis assessment and intervention, and one hour of supervision focusing on group intervention, psychology interns participate in various seminars, training, and peer support spaces.\n\nCaPS views the doctoral psychology internship year as an extension from one’s previous training experiences with added opportunities to expand and hone one’s psychotherapeutic skills via supportive reflection on clinical, personal and professional development. The training program is designed to support interns to develop into well-rounded generalist psychologists at an early-career level. To this end, our training program emphasizes 1): attending to and supporting the intern’s developmental needs; 2): developing the intern’s professional and personal identity by cultivating self-awareness on one’s intersectional identities in context; and 3) integrating practice and clinical theory.\n\nOur training model is developmental in nature and as such is sensitive to the individual needs of trainees with varying levels of knowledge and expertise. Training experiences are gradual throughout the year and based upon the trainee’s readiness as gauged by their supervisor(s), Assistant Director of Training, and the Executive Director.\n\nFollowing a developmental framework, a trainee can expect training to include vicarious and experiential learning. Didactic structure is set up to additionally offer the explicit opportunity to more deeply integrate theory and practice, informed by psychological science.\n\nOur internship year starts on the last weekday of July each year, and the month of August is viewed as a time for orienting interns to the CMU culture, CaPS culture, and the core components of our training program (brief psychotherapy, group therapy, triage, and outreach). In addition to didactic and experiential training that prepares interns for providing triage and consultation services, interns are further oriented to diverse components of services provided at CaPS, such as group and outreach programming. Didactic and experiential learning utilizes an apprenticeship, scaffolding model at the beginning weeks and months of the training year.\n\nAfter the August orientation periods, interns enter the Fall semester with a full clinical and training schedule. For their clinical services, interns receive support from their primary supervisor and members of clinical training staff, including the intern’s TCC supervisor, group supervisors, outreach supervisors, the training director, and the entire team of administrative staff.\n\nTraining activities are built gradually in the Fall and Spring semesters. Interns participate in various seminars (e.g., didactic seminars with rotating presenters and topics, trainee clinical discussion group seminar, decolonizing critical consciousness seminar, supervision seminar, and the trauma seminar), and professional development activities (e.g., staff meeting, psychiatric rounds, peer support group, case conferences).\n\nSocially, interns have a range of experiences with other trainees at CaPS and various staff to enrich their interdisciplinary professional experiences and skills.\n\nWith an aspiration to center on social justice values as an integral part of interns’ development, interns are encouraged and supported to reflect on their own intersectional identities when providing clinical services via consultation with their supervisors. The clinical services, seminar structure, and support offerings are structured to orient the interns around their multicultural awareness and their professional developmental growing edges, and how they intersect with working within systems. Psychology interns receive $300 annual fund for professional development activities that support their learning in topics pertaining to a multicultural approach.\n\nIt is expected that interns will be able to function with an increased sense of agency and independence as they move through the training year.\n\nAt the end of the internship year, interns will be involved in a variety of year-end activities, including offering feedback to the training program about their training experience, participating in the farewell ceremony, and saying goodbye to important relationships they have established throughout the training year. Interns are expected to make appropriate follow-up plans for all of their clinical and non-clinical activities in consultation with their supervisors. Interns strengths and ongoing areas of professional growth will be highlighted with the intern at the end of the training year.\n\nIndividual Counseling and Psychotherapy\n\nThe opportunity to provide short and long-term counseling/psychotherapy under intensive supervision is a unique feature of the training program. The nature of counseling center work ebbs and flows, but interns can expect, on average, to carry 15-17 ongoing clients per week during the academic year. Interns are expected to video-tape and review all therapy sessions. Two hours of individual supervision will be provided each week with the primary supervisor. Interns are expected to review their videotapes with their supervisors.\n\nIntake Assessment\n\nEach intern will perform individual intake assessments and clinical consultations as part of their clinical training.  Interns hone their assessment skills and clinical decision making abilities through this process. Intake assessment training will occur during the orientation process as well as throughout the year under individual supervision.\n\nCase Management, Consultation and Referral Support (CCaRS)\n\nStarting in September, interns will have the opportunity to work directly with our Case Management, Consultation, and Referral Support(CCaRS) Team. Interns are an integral member of CaPS staff, hence for four hours every week, interns provide emergency services/walk-in services to students in crisis. Triage services are provided through a team approach. Supervision of triage, consultation, and case management services is provided in vivo by fellow-clinicians on staff on the same triage team as well as in weekly scheduled supervision by a CCaRS supervisor.\n\nOutreach\n\nInterns are expected to participate in outreach activities at CaPS throughout the training year. At the beginning of the training years, interns will be trained to provide assigned outreach activities via an apprenticeship model. Additionally, interns are expected to participate in at least two outreach programs per semester, in addition to developing an outreach project before the end of the training year.  Interns may be involved in the coordination of outreach requests from the university community. Due to the fluctuating nature of outreach requests, consultation and supervision with the Outreach Coordinator will occur once monthly and on an ad hoc basis.\n\nGroup Therapy\n\nInterns are oriented to the Group program at CaPS and assessed for fit and interests in providing Group Therapy. Much like other components of clinical activities, interns’ training and development in the area of Group Therapy follows an apprenticeship model with scaffolding support by their group supervisor, who usually co-lead the assigned Group with the intern.  Interns may initially join a pre-established group, and there are opportunities for interns to create and lead a group of their specific interests and expertise at the later portion of the training year. Availability of Group facilitation is based on CMU students’ interests and may vary.\n\nPsychiatric Rounds\n\nPsychiatric rounds are held every Tuesday as a space to consult with the psychiatrist regarding on-going clinical cases.  Interns participate in weekly psychiatric rounds with their primary supervisors.\n\nSupervision\n\nInterns receive training in theory and practices of providing clinical supervision in the Fall semester, and gain experiences in supervising practicum students in the Spring semester.\n\nIndividual Supervision\n\nEach intern receives two hours of individual psychotherapy supervision per week with a primary supervisor. The primary supervisor is a clinical psychologist with the role of supporting an intern’s ongoing growth and development throughout the training year, in addition to supervising the intern’s individual psychotherapy cases. Consistent with CaPS treatment and training philosophy, clinical supervision is developmental in nature and grounded in an attunement for diverse human experience. CaPS supervisors come from a wide range of theoretical approaches. Interns can expect supervision to be a place to examine the therapist-client relationship, to observe the emergence of feelings and thoughts as it pertains to clinical work, and to engage in reflection on areas of personal and professional growth. In addition, supervision may involve discussions and open curiosity about all forms of differences between the trainee and the supervisors. Discussions about differences and power dynamics may inform how similar processes could emerge in clinical, institutional, and larger socio-cultural contexts.\n\nCCaRS Supervision\n\nPsychology interns receive one hour of weekly supervision from their CCaRS supervisors. CCaRS supervisors oversee interns’ cases that came through triage, case management, and consultation services. In addition to receiving clinical supervision on the cases, interns can expect to gain knowledge and experiences about resources and systems within and beyond CaPS and CMU. CCaRS supervision is informed by developmental theories, trauma-informed care, and social justice principles.\n\nGroup Supervision\n\nPsychology interns receive one hour of weekly supervision on group therapy. At the beginning of the training year, supervision is facilitated by the group coordinator and focuses on promoting, advertising, programming, and planning for the group. Starting from the first week of co-facilitated a group, interns receive weekly 1 hr supervision from a staff member who is the co-leader of the group. The group supervisor is a source of support for the interns during the group sessions while overseeing the related programming, planning, and refining process of the specific Group. Group supervision is informed by Group theories with multicultural attunement.\n\nSupervision of Supervision\n\nPsychology interns participate in weekly one-hour supervision of supervision group when interns are supervising a junior trainee. Supervision of supervision is informed by supervision theories and techniques with attunement to intersectionality and human in context.\n\nPsychology interns participate in the following seminars throughout the training year.\n\nInterns can expect to receive feedback from staff as colleagues on an ongoing and in vivo basis. To encourage bi-directional learning, interns are encouraged to provide feedback to their supervisor on an ongoing basis.\n\nThere will be a mid-year and end-of-year formal evaluation for each intern. The formal evaluations are written and discussed between the intern and their supervisors. The evaluation will be based on internship goals, expectations, and objectives. Consistent with scientific principles and the core of Health Service Psychology, areas of evaluation are assessed in the following nine areas:\n\nAdditionally, all training staff meet bi-annually to share observations and feedback about interns’ performance, and interns may receive additional feedback at these additional touch points.\n\nTo promote bi-directional learning, interns complete a supervision feedback form to provide feedback to their supervision at mid-year and at the end of the year. This procedure is to offer structural support to review the progress of supervision, and allow adjustment for supervision to meet the interns training needs.\n\nCandidates with specific interests in the intersection of UCC work, depthful/relational/human-centered psychotherapy, and social justice aspiration are encouraged to apply.\n\nConsistent with CaPS Inclusion and Mental Health Statement, the training program strives to offer a training environment that acknowledges and takes steps toward recognizing harm and the many challenges individuals face. The training program welcomes candidates who bring intersectional identities to be a part of the center. Individuals with open curiosity, interests in giving and receiving feedback, and flexibility will be the best fit for this program.\n\nCaPS utilizes the APPI application system through APPIC. Visit the APPIC website to find out more about the AAPI Online Application. The application deadline for our program is November, 15th, 2025. Our APPIC membership number is 2279.\n\nInterviews are typically virtual.

Please see the full list of staff benefits on CMU human resource website.\n\nIn addition to the $300 annual fund for professional development activities that support psychology interns’ on topics pertaining to Inclusion and Mental Health. Interns also receive three professional development days to be utilized toward approved professional development activities (e.g., dissertation defense, presenting at a conference, attending graduation, taking the EPPP, etc.)\n\nInitial Post-Internship Positions\n\n2020-2021\n\n2021-2022\n\n2022-2023\n\n2023-2024\n\nTotal # of Interns who were in the cohort\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0\n\n3\n\nTotal # of Interns who did not seek employment because they returned to their doctoral program and are completing doctoral degree\n\n0\n\n0\n\nNA\n\n0\n\nUniversity Counseling Center\n\n2\n\n2\n\nNA\n\n2\n\nVeteran Affairs Medical Center\n\n0\n\n0\n\nNA\n\n0\n\nAcademic University/Department\n\n0\n\n0\n\nNA\n\n0\n\nIndependent Practice Setting\n\n0\n\n1\n\nNA\n\n0\n\nCommunity Agency\n\n0\n\n0\n\nNA\n\n1\n\nOther\n\n0\n\n0\n\nNA\n\n0\n\nNA= not applicable\n\nEntrance to CaPS from Morewood Avenue\n\nIn this video, walk through CaPS to get ready for your first day.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• 15-17 hours of individual psychotherapy and group therapy\n• 4-5 hours of clinical supervision (2 individual, 1 group, 1 TCC/TCC group, 1 Sup of Sup)\n• 2-4 hours of triage, crisis intervention, or consultation\n• 4 hours of didactic or seminar activities\n• 0-1 hours providing supervision\n• 1-2 hours of trainee support group or peer support activities\n• 2-3 hours of staff or administrative meetings\n• 2 hours of administrative time (e.g., notes, preparing for outreach, etc.)\n• 2 hours of professional development activities (e.g., reading, researching)\n• Unspecified and variable time devoted to outreach planning, implementation, and case management\n\n• Didactic Seminar: The weekly didactic seminar is coordinated by members of the training committee, and led by rotating staff at CaPS in the Fall semester. The weekly, one-hour Didactic presentations and discussions are intended to contribute to trainees overall professional development and to the development of their professional identities. The focus of the didactic presentations are the theoretical, applied, and professional aspects of the practice of Health Service Psychology and that of University Counseling Center work. Additionally, interns can expect to reflect on the application to diversity and social justice topics with the weekly presentations guided and prompted by the presenter.\n• Decolonizing Critical Consciousness Seminar: This seminar focuses on developing a decolonized critical consciousness into the relationship between psychology, culture, and power. This seminar connects the personal with the socio-political to understand both external systems of oppression and the ways they are internalized by individuals and cultural systems. This seminar focuses on differences of power, access and opportunity. In so doing, participants are invited to look up the power hierarchy, where inequalities are embedded in systems and structures that privilege the few at the expense of many.\n• Trauma Seminar: This seminar is an integral part of CaPS internship training program. With the objective of providing clinical training for trauma-informed care, the purpose of the weekly one-hour seminar is to introduce, discuss, and critically reflect on existing literature on theories and treatment approaches for victims and survivors of various forms of violence, including interpersonal violence, community-level violence, and socio-political violence. The covered topics include: the theory of complex trauma, neurobiology and co-morbidity of trauma, the trauma recovery model, trauma treatment approaches, sociopolitical trauma and community healing, and trauma in cultural/historical context.\n• Case Conference: Interns participate in case conferences in the spring semester with CaPS staff. Participants of case conferences will take turns to present a case. The cases may be a client in ongoing therapy, a triage situation, a group case, or an outreach experience. In addition to presentation skills, interns gain experiences in requesting, receiving, and offering feedback to others, consistent with professional consultation practices. Presenters are asked to present cases and pay attention to issues related to diversity, therapeutic process (e.g., transference and countertransference), systems, and beyond.\n• Trainee Clinical Discussion Group: This weekly, open discussion group for CaPS trainees provides participants the opportunity to give voice to their experiences as clinicians, which may include working with particular clients, questions about developing professional identity, possible tensions within the systems where work is conducted or within the systems clients find themselves affected by, emerging ethical dilemmas, frameworks for understanding psychological and interpersonal functioning, biases and insights that may be operating given the clinician’s personal history, cultural background, etc. The group’s facilitators are present and available to offer reflections, assist with group interactions, identify themes, and secure the safety of the group’s process. Group participants are invited to bring a supportive stance toward other members of the group and stay open-minded with an attunement to one’s own internal processes. Ideally, the group will form a working community that supports clinical development for its members by establishing a culture in which disclosure is welcomed and where privacy is safeguarded, and by cultivating a lived sense of securing collegial support for the often-difficult work we face with our clients and within our encompassing professional contexts.\n\n• Research\n• Ethical and legal standards\n• Individual and cultural diversity\n• Professional values, attitudes, and behaviors\n• Communication and interpersonal skills\n• Assessment\n• Intervention\n• Supervision\n• Consultation and interprofessional/interdisciplinary skills\n\n• Full-time position for a full calendar year (7/31/2025 to 7/24/2026)\n• Interns accrue 2000 training hours at the conclusion of the training year.\n• Services at the counseling center are provided primarily between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday; there may be occasions when interns provide clinical services and outreach activities after hours and on weekends.\n• All interns are based out of the counseling center but may spend time at other sites on campus (i.e., offering outreach programming).\n\n• Completed a minimum of at least 500 direct hours in which at least 400 of those hours are doctoral hours of intervention (excluding assessment).  Students with less direct hours due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic are welcome to apply and we ask that applicants address this matter in their cover letters.\n• passed comprehensive exams\n• extensive experiences with individual therapy\n• curiosity and interests in learning about: (a) UCC works, (b) depth-oriented/human-centered brief therapy theory and practices, and (c) social justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion topics\n\n• Previous university or college counseling center experience\n• demonstrated interests and commitment in social justice and a multicultural lense (e.g., social engagement project, completion of graduate-level multicultural courses, etc.)\n• experiences with group therapy, outreach presentations, triage, and assessment\n• dissertation proposal passed by the interview date\n\n• Cover letter.\n• APPIC Application for Psychology Internship (AAPI)\n• Transcripts for all graduate coursework\n• Curriculum Vita\n• Three letters of reference.

Enrollments and waivers do not carry over from the previous academic year.\n\nTo qualify for a waiver, students must verify that they have active medical insurance that meets university requirements. All insurance plans must be active for the duration of your time as an enrolled student. Students (and families where applicable) are responsible for reviewing these requirements and verifying that their medical insurance meets them.\n\nWaiver applications must be submitted by the student, through the insurance portal in SIO, prior to a student's Open Enrollment deadline. If approved, the student insurance charge will be credited back to the student's account. With an approved waiver, a student accepts full financial liability for any medical costs incurred. If a waiver is not approved (because the plan does not meet university requirements), the student must enroll in the CMU student medical insurance plan.\n\nLate waiver applications will be accepted for two weeks after a student's Open Enrollment deadline, and are subject to a $50 late fee.\n\nStudents who have extenuating circumstances and wish to request a waiver beyond the two-week late period must submit a formal appeal. Submitting an appeal does not guarantee that a waiver will be approved, but does allow a student's circumstances to be considered. If an appeal is granted and the waiver is approved, the student will be responsible for paying the student medical plan premium for the months of enrollment. Waiver appeals are not accepted after 90 days from a student's Open Enrollment deadline. Contact the Student Health Insurance Team  for late waiver requests and appeals.\n\nIn order to waive CMU's Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), all full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. must have health insurance that meets the following requirements:\n\nStudents must have continuous medical insurance coverage for their duration of time as an enrolled student. The insurance plan must be in force for the academic year/semester (whichever applies) to ensure there is no gap in coverage:\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• Part-time students who wish to waive SHIP only need to provide proof of active insurance. The insurance plan does not need to meet all university requirements for a waiver.\n• Study Abroad students should refer to our study abroad section for additional waiver details.\n\n• Jul 1 - Aug 22\n                                Fall Open Enrollment: for all new and returning CMU students\n\n• During Open Enrollment: log into SIO > Campus Life > Health Insurance\n• Click the enroll/waive portal link\n• Choose the option to waive\n• Fill out your details and upload the front and back of your current medical insurance card\n• Click CONFIRM on the final screen to submit\n\n• is provided by a company licensed to do business in the United States, with a U.S. claims payment office and a U.S. phone number;\n• has unlimited annual and lifetime benefits (i.e., no policy maximum);\n• will be in force for the duration of your time as a student for the academic year/semester (whichever applies);\n• has a maximum deductible of $5,000 individual/$10,000 family. If the student’s deductible is greater than $5,000/$10,000, the student must have a Healthcare Savings Account (HSA/HRA/FSA) that will allow the student to seek needed medical and mental health care that covers all deductible expenses over $5,000/$10,000 (catastrophic health plans are not acceptable);\n• covers all of the following with no session limits (a policy that covers only emergency/ urgent care in the location where the student is studying does not meet this requirement): routine, urgent and emergent care for both inpatient and outpatient medical care; mental health treatment; and alcohol and substance abuse treatment;\n• Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plans are acceptable only when the student is physically located in the provider network service area or has an “away from home” rider or guest membership that assures coverage commensurate with minimum requirements;\n• Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Plans are acceptable only when the student is physically located in the same state/area that provides the plan. (Examples: Acceptable: Student residing in Pittsburgh and has Western PA Medicaid; Not Acceptable: Student residing in Pittsburgh and has MD Medicaid); and\n• provides coverage for pre-existing conditions with no waiting period or limitations.\n\n• Fall students - if you are beginning studies in the fall term, you must have insurance active as of August 1.\n• Spring students - if you are beginning studies in the spring term, you must have insurance active as of January 1.\n• Summer students - if you are beginning studies in the summer term, you must have insurance active as of May 1.\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsibility\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\n• Disability Resources\n• Title IX Initiatives\n• University Police\n• University Policies\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• © 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Facebook\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• HealthConnect\n• New Students\n• Family & Parents\n• Student Insurance\n    \n\n                      Enroll in the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Waive the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Change or Cancel the SHIP \n    \n\n                      SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n    \n\n                      SHIP Rates & Billing\n    \n\n                      Using the SHIP\n    \n\n                      International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n    \n\n                      Insurance Literacy\n    \n\n                      Contacts & Common Questions\n    \n\n                      Leaving CMU\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n• Services & Fees\n    \n\n                      COVID19 \n    \n\n                      Sexual Assault Resources\n    \n\n                      LGBTQIA+ Health\n    \n\n                      Sexual Health\n    \n\n                      Allergy Injections\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n• Health Education & Resources\n    \n\n                      Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n    \n\n                      Local Healthcare Resources\n    \n\n                      Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n    \n\n\n\n                      Recovery and Harm Reduction\n    \n\n                      Wellness To Go Machines\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n• About Us\n    \n\n                      UHS News\n    \n\n                      Who We Are\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n\n• Information for PHAs\n\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2157",

However, in a health care emergency where you are incapacitated or otherwise unable to advocate for yourself, UHS will notify your emergency contact if necessary, regardless of whether or not you have a health care power of attorney.\n\n• CMU Coronavirus Information\n• Undergraduate Family Engagement\n• Graduate Students Family & Partners\n• Student Support & Resources\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsibility\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\n• Disability Resources\n• Title IX Initiatives\n• University Police\n• University Policies\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• © 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Facebook\n• CMU on Twitter\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• HealthConnect\n• New Students\n• Family & Parents\n• Student Insurance\n    \n\n                      Enroll in the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Waive the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Change or Cancel the SHIP \n    \n\n                      SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n    \n\n                      SHIP Rates & Billing\n    \n\n                      Using the SHIP\n    \n\n                      International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n    \n\n                      Insurance Literacy\n    \n\n                      Contacts & Common Questions\n    \n\n                      Leaving CMU\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n• Services & Fees\n    \n\n                      COVID19 \n    \n\n                      Sexual Assault Resources\n    \n\n                      LGBTQIA+ Health\n    \n\n                      Sexual Health\n    \n\n                      Allergy Injections\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n• Health Education & Resources\n    \n\n                      Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n    \n\n                      Local Healthcare Resources\n    \n\n                      Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n    \n\n\n\n                      Recovery and Harm Reduction\n    \n\n                      Wellness To Go Machines\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n• About Us\n    \n\n                      UHS News\n    \n\n                      Who We Are\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n\n• Information for PHAs\n\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2157",

These might include long-term psychotherapy, psychiatric care, psychological evaluations, or specialized care for things like eating disorders and substance abuse problems.\n\nStudents who already know they want to connect with services in the community may call CaPS for assistance and to discuss options. You will likely have to use your health insurance to pay for services. Typically, your health insurance will cover a portion of the cost per session. Please note that for those students using the CMU Highmark Health Insurance, therapy sessions with an in-network provider are covered in full with no copayment. Please confirm that your chosen provider is in-network when making your first appointment. Learn more about the Student Health Insurance plan.\n\nYou can find local resources on the CaPS resources page, going to APA’s Find a Psychologist, or checking with your health insurance website.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsiblity\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Professional Training\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• Â© 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• Get Support\n    \n\n                      Support For Yourself\n    \n\n                      For Someone Else\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n• Services\n    \n\n                      Gender Affirming Care\n    \n\n                      Let's Talk\n    \n\n                      Consultation\n    \n\n                      Groups & Skills Clinics\n    \n\n                      Individual Therapy\n    \n\n                      Outreach Prevention & Education\n    \n\n                      Psychiatric Care\n    \n\n                      Referrals\n    \n\n                      Tele-Mental Health\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n• TimelyCare\n• Resources\n• Professional Training\n• Get Involved\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n    \n\n                      Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Contact CaPS\n• About CaPS\n    \n\n                      Frequently Asked Questions\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• CaPS Event D-List Sign Up\n\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2922",

Therapists are also available to consult with any member of the university community regarding student mental health concerns.\n\nWhat is confidentiality?\n\nRespecting your confidentiality is one of Counseling and Psychological Services’ (CaPS) highest priorities. We maintain confidentiality to the limits provided by Pennsylvania law and FERPA guidelines. In accordance with law, we do not release information to anyone outside of CaPS (including parents, administrators, faculty, or potential employers), or disclose that you have received care, without your explicit permission.\n\nIn most cases, the only information others have about your experiences in therapy is what you choose to tell them yourself. Counseling records, including the scheduling of appointments and content of counseling sessions, are maintained in files completely separate from the student’s academic records and cannot be accessed by faculty, parents, or any non-CaPS staff without your explicit authorization.\n\nIn the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania any individual over the age of 14 has the right to keep treatment private from their parents. If you want CaPS to communicate with family members, faculty/staff, or other providers, you can discuss this with a CaPS clinician and complete a Release of Information Form (ROI).\n\nThere are exceptions to confidentiality. By law we are obligated to disclose personal information without permission in emergency situations where information is needed to protect the safety of someone whose life may be at risk. You can discuss any concerns you have about the limits to confidentiality with your CaPS therapist at any time.\n\nCaPS may contact you by phone, email or voicemail as needed and will ask you, upon your first appointment, your preferred method of contact.\n\nEmail is not a confidential form of communication so we won’t use email to initiate therapeutic conversations. Things we do communicate by email are appointment reminders, reaching out in case of absence, and scheduling purposes.\n\nTo ensure a confidential, safe environment via teletherapy, you will receive a link to a personalized Zoom room from your clinician. Access to this Zoom room is only provided to whomever the clinician allows into the room. For any session, each person's identity and access to safe and confidential spaces are confirmed for each individual present. Clinicians will meet with you from a secure location, with headphones and/or noise canceling sound machines turned on in their spaces so that no other individuals outside of their respective offices may hear the conversations occurring.\n\nYour consent to treatment includes sharing limited information with members of CMU’s University Health Services where necessary to coordinate your medical care and treatment.\n\nIn addition to providing psychological and psychiatric services, CMU CaPS serves as a training clinic. This means that one of our functions is to provide direct clinical experience for graduate students, doctoral interns, post-doctoral fellows and other clinicians working to become fully-licensed psychologists, licensed counselors or to obtain additional credentials.\n\nYour treatment provider may be a therapist-in-training. If that is the case, upon the first meeting, you will be notified of their training status and learn who their supervisor is. You have the choice to change providers if this is not someone who you want to meet with. As part of their training you will be asked if the session can be video recorded, with the purpose of getting feedback by their supervisor regarding their performance. You have the right to deny being recorded or request that the recording device be turned off at any time. Sessions recordings are for supervisory and training purposes only, and are kept on a secure server with access limited only to supervising staff. Any information that you reveal, whether oral or written, will not be discussed or shared with anyone outside of CMU CaPS professional staff without your prior written permission. The recordings are erased promptly after their supervisor provides them with feedback.\n\nPsychiatry service is the only service at CaPS that bills health insurance, and only the student health plan is accepted. For that purpose, we will disclose student medical records to CMU’s Student Health Insurance provider to obtain reimbursement for your health care or to determine eligibility or coverage. Additionally, when billing student accounts, name, date of service and fee are provided to add that to your account. Please know that this, on the student account, is simply labeled as “Student Health Service.” For more information on billing, visit the Psychiatry webpage.\n\nIf you have questions or other concerns about your privacy rights, you may contact the associate director for Clinical Services at CaPS at 412-268-2922.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• To be treated without discrimination and with respect to differences related to race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, personal values, age, disability, and economic or veteran status.\n• To affirm your preferred name and pronouns.\n• To be treated in a courteous and caring manner.\n• To good quality care provided by competent and culturally sensitive professionals and staff.\n• To a private and confidential space for treatment.\n• To receive information you need to participate in decisions about your care, and to give consent before any diagnostic or treatment procedure is performed.\n• To be informed of treatment options available to you.\n• To make informed decisions about your treatment and express your desires to your treating therapist.\n• To include family members in your treatment choices.\n• To decline treatment at any point and to be given information about the consequences of such actions.\n• To review and obtain your treatment records.\n• To ask for and receive an explanation of any charges billed by CMU.\n• To provide feedback to the center regarding their care and treatment experience.\n\n• To provide correct and complete information about their health and past mental health and medical history.\n• To report if they do not understand the planned treatment or their part in the plan.\n• To treat others with respect including CaPS staff, peers in the waiting room, and treating providers.\n• To keep your appointment, or change or cancel it in a timely manner, to allow others in need to have access to treatment.\n• To protect the privacy of staff and other clients by refraining from photography or video / audio recording on CaPS premises.\n• To follow the care, service, or treatment plan developed.\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsiblity\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Professional Training\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• Â© 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• Get Support\n    \n\n                      Support For Yourself\n    \n\n                      For Someone Else\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n• Services\n    \n\n                      Gender Affirming Care\n    \n\n                      Let's Talk\n    \n\n                      Consultation\n    \n\n                      Groups & Skills Clinics\n    \n\n                      Individual Therapy\n    \n\n                      Outreach Prevention & Education\n    \n\n                      Psychiatric Care\n    \n\n                      Referrals\n    \n\n                      Tele-Mental Health\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n• TimelyCare\n• Resources\n• Professional Training\n• Get Involved\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n    \n\n                      Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Contact CaPS\n• About CaPS\n    \n\n                      Frequently Asked Questions\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• CaPS Event D-List Sign Up\n\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2922",

That is why all full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. are required to meet CMU's health insurance mandate each academic year.\n\nTo fulfill this mandate students must have insurance that meets university requirements for the duration of their time as an enrolled student, either through enrolling in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), or obtaining a SHIP waiver:\n\nSHIP Eligibility\n\nAll full-time and part-time degree-seeking Carnegie Mellon students, and their eligible dependents, are eligible to enroll in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) during their Open Enrollment period.  Students can also enroll in the SHIP, or add eligible dependents to their existing SHIP enrollments, outside of Open Enrollment due to a Qualifying Life Event (QLE).\n\nOpen Enrollment is the period during which students must enroll in the CMU SHIP or apply to waive it. SHIP enrollments, and waiver applications, are submitted through the insurance portal in Student Information Online (SIO).\n\nHow to submit and enrollment/waiver during Open Enrollment\n\nStudents who do not take any action to enroll in, or waive, the CMU SHIP during their Open Enrollment period will be auto-enrolled into the CMU SHIP medical plan.\n\nWe strongly recommend that students do not wait to be auto-enrolled:\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• The enroll/waive process must be completed during a student's Open Enrollment period.\n\nSHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n• SHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n• If you do not have insurance that meets university requirements you must enroll in the medical SHIP.\n• By default, a SHIP placeholder charge is posted to your student account, until you complete Open Enrollment.\n• If you do not complete Open Enrollment you will be auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP.  Auto enrollments are not recommended, and beginning in Fall 25 will incur a $50 processing fee.\n\n• SHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n\n• Open Enrollment\n• CMU Insurance Waiver Requirements\n• SHIP Rates\n• SHIP Coverage & Plan Documents\n• Insurance Frequently Asked Questions\n\n• Open Enrollment periods correspond with a student's first active semester at CMU each academic year.\n• Students who do not enroll or waive during their Open Enrollment period are auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP (not recommended).\n• By default, a placeholder charge for the CMU SHIP is posted to each student's account.\n\nDuring Open Enrollment this placeholder charge, and payment of this fee, does not indicate a SHIP enrollment. \nStudents who apply for and receive an approved waiver will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.\nStudents who enroll in the SHIP will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.

Certain programs also require this of their part-time students. Students must take this action during their Open Enrollment period, through the insurance portal in Student Information Online (SIO).\n\nWhen deciding whether to enroll in the SHIP, or submit a SHIP waiver, it is important to review all the benefits and guidelines. And there are some important distinctions for international, exchange, and study abroad students:\n\nFall Term Study Abroad\n\nStudents who study abroad are required to either enroll in the SHIP or apply to waive it, during the Fall Open Enrollment period.  Students who take no action during this time will be auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP.\n\nSpring Term Study Abroad\n\nStudents going abroad for the Spring term will have already met the insurance requirement during the Fall Open Enrollment period and either have a SHIP enrollment or an approved waiver. There is no action required.\n\nInformation on immunization requirements and health forms can be found on the UHS website. For questions about immunizations and health forms, email Health Services.\n\nWhen deciding whether to enroll in the SHIP, or apply to waive it, it is helpful to first review SHIP benefits for the medical, dental and vision plans. It is also important to consider the following:\n\nAll medical insurance plans must meet university waiver requirements. It is important to carefully review these requirements against your current plan, as most insurance plans from outside the U.S. will not meet our waiver requirements. Travel insurance plans do not meet university waiver requirements. Most travel plans only provide medical coverage for emergencies and do not provide coverage for routine exams (such as a check-up), pre-existing conditions, or mental health.\n\nThe only exception to this rule is for domestic students studying abroad during the the Fall term.\n\nIf you are unsure whether your plan meets CMU requirements, you can request a plan review through the Student Health Insurance Office. Be sure to make the request prior to purchasing the plan.\n\nAll insurance plans must be effective the first of the month you arrive on campus, and remain active for the duration of your time as an enrolled student. Please do not wait until you arrive in the U.S. to secure your insurance plan, or the effective date could be too late, and your waiver will be denied. Start looking into plans as soon as possible to ensure the plan will start when needed:\n\nIf you arrive either before or after these dates, contact the CMU Student Health Insurance Office for assistance.\n\nInternational students must have a U.S. address to enroll in the SHIP. This address is where you will receive your insurance member ID card and other insurance documents, so it is important that you can receive mail there. If you do not have a U.S. address prior to your arrival, please wait until you have arrived to enroll:\n\nFor any questions about SHIP enrollments and reimbursements, please contact the Student Health Insurance Office.\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• Must have a U.S. address to enroll in the SHIP. Enrollments submitted with a non-U.S. address or an incomplete address will not be processed.

You can, however, cancel if you graduate in December.\n• If you are waiving the SHIP, you must have insurance that meets CMU's requirements.\n• If your spouse and/or dependent child is joining you from overseas you can add them to your SHIP enrollment due to that Qualifying Life Event (QLE). \n\nFor any questions relating to visa requirements, please contact the Office of International Education.\n• For any questions relating to visa requirements, please contact the Office of International Education.\n\n• When submitting an address, please include the apartment/room number, if applicable, or your member ID will not be delivered.\n\n• For any questions relating to visa requirements, please contact the Office of International Education.\n\n• Must have a U.S. address to enroll in the SHIP.

UHS offers guidance on what to look for and how to treat your symptoms.\n\nCall UHS for the following:\n\nFor more information about COVID19 care at UHS visit our services and fees page.\n\nThe flu vaccine is available to students at UHS and covered by the student health insurance plan (SHIP). See our services and fees page for cost without SHIP. If you do not have the SHIP, check with your insurance company to see if the vaccine is covered.\n\nVaccination appointments can be scheduled online via HealthConnect, appointments available daily.\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFLUENZA (FLU) AND COVID-19?\n\nSick with the flu? Know what to do!\n\nInfluenza (or flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by flu viruses. Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs. If you get flu symptoms, in most cases, you should stay home and avoid contact with others except to get medical care.\n\nKnow the Symptoms of Flu\n\nFlu viruses can cause mild to severe illness, and at can lead to death. The flu is different from a cold. The flu usually come on suddenly.\n\nPeople who have the flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: fever* or feeling feverish/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue (tiredness). Some people have vomiting and diarrhea, which is more common in children.\n\n*It's important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever.\n\nTake antiviral drugs if your doctor prescribes them.\n\nAntiviral drugs can be used to treat flu illness. Antiviral drugs can make illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu complications.\n\nCDC recommends that antiviral drugs be used early to treat people who are very sick with the flu and people who get flu symptoms who are at high risk of serious flu complications, either because of their age or because they have a high risk medical condition.\n\nStay home when sick.\n\nWhen you are sick, limit  contact with others as much as possible. Remember to cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when your cough or sneeze, and throw tissues in the trash after you use them. Stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities.\n\nYour fever should be gone for 24 hours without the use of a fever-reducing medicine before resuming normal activities.\n\nSymptom onset\n\nFatigue, weakness\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• Severe symptoms (fever greater than 103 fahrenheit, severe cough, or shortness of breath)\n• Chronic conditions or if you are immunocompromised\n• Symptoms for more than 7 days\n\n• If you have mild cold and flu symptoms (see below) we recommend that you treat your symptoms with over the counter medications and stay home and isolate until you have no fever for 24 hours. The best way to prevent spread of upper respiratory viruses is to avoid unnecessary exposure and wear a high quality mask around others.\n• If you are concerned about COVID-19 and have mild symptoms rapid antigen tests are available over the counter.

That is why all full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. are required to meet CMU's health insurance mandate each academic year.\n\nTo fulfill this mandate students must have insurance that meets university requirements for the duration of their time as an enrolled student, either through enrolling in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), or obtaining a SHIP waiver:\n\nSHIP Eligibility\n\nAll full-time and part-time degree-seeking Carnegie Mellon students, and their eligible dependents, are eligible to enroll in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) during their Open Enrollment period.  Students can also enroll in the SHIP, or add eligible dependents to their existing SHIP enrollments, outside of Open Enrollment due to a Qualifying Life Event (QLE).\n\nOpen Enrollment is the period during which students must enroll in the CMU SHIP or apply to waive it. SHIP enrollments, and waiver applications, are submitted through the insurance portal in Student Information Online (SIO).\n\nHow to submit and enrollment/waiver during Open Enrollment\n\nStudents who do not take any action to enroll in, or waive, the CMU SHIP during their Open Enrollment period will be auto-enrolled into the CMU SHIP medical plan.\n\nWe strongly recommend that students do not wait to be auto-enrolled:\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• The enroll/waive process must be completed during a student's Open Enrollment period.\n\nSHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n• SHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n• If you do not have insurance that meets university requirements you must enroll in the medical SHIP.\n• By default, a SHIP placeholder charge is posted to your student account, until you complete Open Enrollment.\n• If you do not complete Open Enrollment you will be auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP.  Auto enrollments are not recommended, and beginning in Fall 25 will incur a $50 processing fee.\n\n• SHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n\n• Open Enrollment\n• CMU Insurance Waiver Requirements\n• SHIP Rates\n• SHIP Coverage & Plan Documents\n• Insurance Frequently Asked Questions\n\n• Open Enrollment periods correspond with a student's first active semester at CMU each academic year.\n• Students who do not enroll or waive during their Open Enrollment period are auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP (not recommended).\n• By default, a placeholder charge for the CMU SHIP is posted to each student's account.\n\nDuring Open Enrollment this placeholder charge, and payment of this fee, does not indicate a SHIP enrollment. \nStudents who apply for and receive an approved waiver will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.\nStudents who enroll in the SHIP will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account. The insurance premium fee will then be assessed for the plans they enroll in (medical, dental, and/or vision).\nIf auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP the insurance fee will remain on the account, and beginning in Fall 25 will also incur a $50 processing fee.\n• During Open Enrollment this placeholder charge, and payment of this fee, does not indicate a SHIP enrollment.\n• Students who apply for and receive an approved waiver will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.\n• Students who enroll in the SHIP will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account. The insurance premium fee will then be assessed for the plans they enroll in (medical, dental, and/or vision).\n• If auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP the insurance fee will remain on the account, and beginning in Fall 25 will also incur a $50 processing fee.\n• Optional dental and vision plans are available during a student’s Open Enrollment period.\n\n• During Open Enrollment this placeholder charge, and payment of this fee, does not indicate a SHIP enrollment.\n• Students who apply for and receive an approved waiver will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.\n• Students who enroll in the SHIP will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.

Students can only enroll in these optional plans during their Open Enrollment period.\n• Auto-enrollments are processed using the latest U.S. address or campus SMC mailbox listed in SIO. If your insurance card is sent to an outdated address, you will need to request an address change and order a new card.\n\n• If you need health care before your enrollment is processed you will likely have to pay for the services, or medication, and submit a claim to the SHIP for reimbursement.\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsibility\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\n• Disability Resources\n• Title IX Initiatives\n• University Police\n• University Policies\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• © 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Facebook\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• HealthConnect\n• New Students\n• Family & Parents\n• Student Insurance\n    \n\n                      Enroll in the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Waive the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Change or Cancel the SHIP \n    \n\n                      SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n    \n\n                      SHIP Rates & Billing\n    \n\n                      Using the SHIP\n    \n\n                      International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n    \n\n                      Insurance Literacy\n    \n\n                      Contacts & Common Questions\n    \n\n                      Leaving CMU\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n• Services & Fees\n    \n\n                      COVID19 \n    \n\n                      Sexual Assault Resources\n    \n\n                      LGBTQIA+ Health\n    \n\n                      Sexual Health\n    \n\n                      Allergy Injections\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n• Health Education & Resources\n    \n\n                      Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n    \n\n                      Local Healthcare Resources\n    \n\n                      Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n    \n\n\n\n                      Recovery and Harm Reduction\n    \n\n                      Wellness To Go Machines\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n• About Us\n    \n\n                      UHS News\n    \n\n                      Who We Are\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n\n• Information for PHAs\n\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2157",

Please review the following details regarding health records, health insurance, and online courses.\n\nAll new students to the Pittsburgh & Silicon Valley campuses must submit required health forms and immunization information, including uploading a CMU Immunization Record Form signed by their healthcare provider before arriving on campus.\n\nStudents should log into HealthConnect and select Medical Clearances to review and submit all required health information. New fall students can access HealthConnect after commencement, in mid-May.\n\nFailure to comply with the below requirements will result in administrative suspension and removal from university housing.\n\nNew students must enter all immunization doses and dates, and upload the CMU Immunization Record Form (signed by a health care provider) in HealthConnect\n\nNew fall semester students must submit immunization information by August 1.\n\nNew spring semester students must submit immunization information by December 1.\n\nMeasles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR)\n\nVaricella (Chickenpox)\n\nMeningococcal AYWC (applies to students living in university housing)\n\nTuberculosis (TB) Screening Form\n\nThe following nearby pharmacies offer Varicella, Meningitis, and MMR vaccines on a walk-in basis and are in-network for CMU SHIP (so the vaccines are fully covered for students with CMU SHIP):\n\nCVS MinuteClinic\n\nGiant Eagle Market District Pharmacy\n\nGiant Eagle Pharmacy\n\nAllegheny County Health Department Immunization Clinic is another local option for vaccines.\n\nAfter commencement, new students can access all of our online forms and upload records in HealthConnect, under Medical Clearances in the left menu.\n\nPlease note: in order to access HealthConnect, your birthdate in the Student Information System (SIO) must be correct. If you are unable to access HealthConnect, check your birthdate in SIO. If it is incorrect, correct it at the HUB. The following day, it should be updated in HealthConnect. If you still have problems, email us for help.\n\nYes, if vaccination is not advised for medical reasons or conflicts with your religious belief/strong moral or ethical conviction. You can find and submit a vaccine exemption form in HealthConnect, under Downloadable Forms, or find them below:\n\nApplication for Personal or Religious Belief Exemption\n\nApplication for Medical Exemption\n\nIf a contagious disease outbreak occurs, the University reserves the right to ask students who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until the outbreak is over.\n\nAll full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. must have medical insurance that meets university requirements; certain programs also require this of their part-time students. Students must fullfil CMU's insurance mandate during their Open Enrollment period.\n\nPrior to a student's Open Enrollment period, a placeholder fee for the CMU Medical SHIP is posted on their student account. This charge is credited back for students who apply for and receive an approved waiver during open enrollment.\n\nThe CMU Student Health Insurance Medical Plan (CMU SHIP) is available to CMU undergraduate and graduate students, and their eligible dependents, during their Open Enrollment period. Optional vision and dental plans are also available.\n\nStudents must enroll in CMU SHIP or apply for a waiver each academic year, during their Open Enrollment period. Students who do not take action to either enroll or waive will be auto-enrolled in the medical CMU SHIP.\n\nAddtional questions?  Review our Common Questions page.\n\nIf You Enroll in the CMU SHIP\n\nThe insurance premium fees will remain on your student account. If you enroll in the vision or dental plans, or add dependents, the additional charges will be posted to your account once the enrollments have been processed.\n\nIf You Apply for a Waiver\n\nIf your current insurance meets university requirements you may apply for a SHIP waiver. If approved, the student insurance charge will be credited back to the your student account.\n\nIf You Take No Action (not recommended)\n\nIf you do not enroll in SHIP, or apply for a waiver, during your Open Enrollment period, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU Medical SHIP, and the insurance premium fee will remain on your student account. And starting in Fall 25, auto-enrollments will also incur a $50 processing fee.\n\nWaiting for this default-enrollment will delay access to your insurance details, so it is not recommended. If you intend to enroll in the student health insurance plan, please complete the steps to enroll during your Open Enrollment period.\n\nHealth and safety are critically important to the student experience, both in and out of the classroom. All new undergraduate students must complete online courses about substance use safety and sexual violence prevention. Incoming undergraduate students will receive access on Canvas on July 15th to two courses: Safer Scotties- Navigating Substance Use and Safer Scotties- Healthy Relationships. Incoming students should complete these courses by August 16th.\n\nHaving issues with the course?

For the CMU SHIP, most copays are $0-$25. Some services have a higher copay, such as advanced imaging ($40), emergency room visits ($125), and hospital admissions ($150). You must pay the copay once for each visit where it is applicable. Prescriptions also incur a copay, but copays depend on the type of medication and frequency of refill.\n\nA deductible is the amount of money you pay for health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay covered expenses. It is important to review insurance plans so you are aware if there is a deductible or not. Once the deductible is met, the plan will start covering benefits as outlined in the policy.\n\nThe CMU medical SHIP has no deductible for in-network care, but there is a deductible for out-of-network care. The dental SHIP has a deductible for both in-network and out-of-network care.\n\nCoinsurance is a portion of healthcare charges that the member is responsible to pay, usually after a deductible has been met. There is no coinsurance for in-network care with the CMU medical SHIP. For out-of-network care with the CMU SHIP, you would be responsible for 20% of covered charges, after paying the deductible amount. Coinsurance rates vary depending on the plan and the service, so you must review plan(s) carefully.\n\nEOBs show the total charges for your visit and which portion of charges the health insurance plan will cover. EOBs are not bills. EOBs help you understand how much your health plan covers, and what you can expect to pay when you get a bill from your provider.\n\nTHE CMU SHIP is a Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO plan.\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• In-Network providers (doctors) or facilities (laboratories, urgent care centers, hospitals, or imaging centers) participate in your insurance plan network. The most cost effective way to seek care is to see healthcare providers that are in-network. If you have the CMU SHIP and see an in-network provider, there is no deductible.\n• Out-of-Network providers do not participate in your insurance plan network. If you have the CMU medical SHIP and see an out-of-network provider, the plan will cover 80% of the cost of the service after you meet your deductible. The dental plan has different coinsurance rates.\n\n• Students can access their EOBs in the claims section of their Highmark portal.\n\n• A PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) medical plan provides healthcare coverage through a network of providers, and you pay less if you use providers and hospitals within the plan's network. However, you can go outside of the network for an additional cost (see coinsurance).\n• An HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) plan provides healthcare coverage through a network of providers, but you are generally limited to seeing providers within the HMO network for covered services, with limited or no coverage for out-of-network care (except for emergencies). HMO networks are generally limited to the area where the person lived at the time of their enrollment.\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsibility\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\n• Disability Resources\n• Title IX Initiatives\n• University Police\n• University Policies\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• © 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Facebook\n• CMU on Twitter\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• HealthConnect\n• New Students\n• Family & Parents\n• Student Insurance\n    \n\n                      Enroll in the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Waive the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Change or Cancel the SHIP \n    \n\n                      SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n    \n\n                      SHIP Rates & Billing\n    \n\n                      Using the SHIP\n    \n\n                      International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n    \n\n                      Insurance Literacy\n    \n\n                      Contacts & Common Questions\n    \n\n                      Leaving CMU\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n• Services & Fees\n    \n\n                      COVID19 \n    \n\n                      Sexual Assault Resources\n    \n\n                      LGBTQIA+ Health\n    \n\n                      Sexual Health\n    \n\n                      Allergy Injections\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n• Health Education & Resources\n    \n\n                      Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n    \n\n                      Local Healthcare Resources\n    \n\n                      Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n    \n\n\n\n                      Recovery and Harm Reduction\n    \n\n                      Wellness To Go Machines\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n• About Us\n    \n\n                      UHS News\n    \n\n                      Who We Are\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n\n• Information for PHAs\n\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2157",

Please review the following details regarding health records, health insurance, and online courses.\n\nAll new students to the Pittsburgh & Silicon Valley campuses must submit required health forms and immunization information, including uploading a CMU Immunization Record Form signed by their healthcare provider before arriving on campus.\n\nStudents should log into HealthConnect and select Medical Clearances to review and submit all required health information. New fall students can access HealthConnect after commencement, in mid-May.\n\nFailure to comply with the below requirements will result in administrative suspension and removal from university housing.\n\nNew students must enter all immunization doses and dates, and upload the CMU Immunization Record Form (signed by a health care provider) in HealthConnect\n\nNew fall semester students must submit immunization information by August 1.\n\nNew spring semester students must submit immunization information by December 1.\n\nMeasles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR)\n\nVaricella (Chickenpox)\n\nMeningococcal AYWC (applies to students living in university housing)\n\nTuberculosis (TB) Screening Form\n\nThe following nearby pharmacies offer Varicella, Meningitis, and MMR vaccines on a walk-in basis and are in-network for CMU SHIP (so the vaccines are fully covered for students with CMU SHIP):\n\nCVS MinuteClinic\n\nGiant Eagle Market District Pharmacy\n\nGiant Eagle Pharmacy\n\nAllegheny County Health Department Immunization Clinic is another local option for vaccines.\n\nAfter commencement, new students can access all of our online forms and upload records in HealthConnect, under Medical Clearances in the left menu.\n\nPlease note: in order to access HealthConnect, your birthdate in the Student Information System (SIO) must be correct. If you are unable to access HealthConnect, check your birthdate in SIO. If it is incorrect, correct it at the HUB. The following day, it should be updated in HealthConnect. If you still have problems, email us for help.\n\nYes, if vaccination is not advised for medical reasons or conflicts with your religious belief/strong moral or ethical conviction. You can find and submit a vaccine exemption form in HealthConnect, under Downloadable Forms, or find them below:\n\nApplication for Personal or Religious Belief Exemption\n\nApplication for Medical Exemption\n\nIf a contagious disease outbreak occurs, the University reserves the right to ask students who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until the outbreak is over.\n\nAll full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. must have medical insurance that meets university requirements; certain programs also require this of their part-time students. Students must fullfil CMU's insurance mandate during their Open Enrollment period.\n\nPrior to a student's Open Enrollment period, a placeholder fee for the CMU Medical SHIP is posted on their student account. This charge is credited back for students who apply for and receive an approved waiver during open enrollment.\n\nThe CMU Student Health Insurance Medical Plan (CMU SHIP) is available to CMU undergraduate and graduate students, and their eligible dependents, during their Open Enrollment period. Optional vision and dental plans are also available.\n\nStudents must enroll in CMU SHIP or apply for a waiver each academic year, during their Open Enrollment period. Students who do not take action to either enroll or waive will be auto-enrolled in the medical CMU SHIP.\n\nAddtional questions?  Review our Common Questions page.\n\nIf You Enroll in the CMU SHIP\n\nThe insurance premium fees will remain on your student account. If you enroll in the vision or dental plans, or add dependents, the additional charges will be posted to your account once the enrollments have been processed.\n\nIf You Apply for a Waiver\n\nIf your current insurance meets university requirements you may apply for a SHIP waiver. If approved, the student insurance charge will be credited back to the your student account.\n\nIf You Take No Action (not recommended)\n\nIf you do not enroll in SHIP, or apply for a waiver, during your Open Enrollment period, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU Medical SHIP, and the insurance premium fee will remain on your student account. And starting in Fall 25, auto-enrollments will also incur a $50 processing fee.\n\nWaiting for this default-enrollment will delay access to your insurance details, so it is not recommended. If you intend to enroll in the student health insurance plan, please complete the steps to enroll during your Open Enrollment period.\n\nHealth and safety are critically important to the student experience, both in and out of the classroom. All new undergraduate students must complete online courses about substance use safety and sexual violence prevention. Incoming undergraduate students will receive access on Canvas on July 15th to two courses: Safer Scotties- Navigating Substance Use and Safer Scotties- Healthy Relationships. Incoming students should complete these courses by August 16th.\n\nHaving issues with the course? Questions? contact healthpromotion@andrew.cmu.edu\n\nHealthConnect is our secure online portal, where students can complete health history and immunizations forms, schedule certain appointments, order prescription refills, request medical records and more.\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• Immunizations\n• Health Insurance\n• Safer Scotties: Navigating Substance Use & Healthy Relationships\n• HealthConnect\n\n• 2 doses after age 1 or\n• combination of 2 measles vaccines, 2 mumps vaccines and 1 rubella vaccine, or\n• positive immunoglobin (IgG) antibody blood test to each (proves immunity)\n\n• 2 doses after age 1 or\n• birth in the U.S. before 1980, or\n• Date of disease, or\n• positive Immunoglobin (IgG) antibody blood test (proves immunity)\n\n• single dose of Quadrivalent or Pentavalent at or after age 16\n• Pennsylvania requires the completed Meningitis AYWC vaccine.\n• We also strongly recommend the Meningitis B vaccine.\n\n• Followed by TB testing, if indicated with Blood IGRA test.  If you recently received a live vaccine (like MMR, Varicella, Yellow Fever, oral Typhoid, or nasal Flu), you should wait 4 weeks before testing.

We also appreciate how matters of religion and spirituality intersect with mental health as potential sources of both psychological resilience and psychological stress. CaPS strives to provide interculturally responsive clinical services and collaborates with campus partners to support students from diverse spiritual and religious backgrounds.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• CMU Student Affairs Religious and Spiritual Life Initiatives - Support and resources for all students along the spectrum of religious and spiritual practice and exploration\n• Interfaith Youth Core (IFYC) - A non-profit established by Eboo Patel that supports interfaith cooperation as a social norm\n• The Mental Health Benefits of Religion and Spirituality - An article from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) on the psychological benefits of religion and spirituality\n• Spirituality and Mental Health - An article from the UK based Royal College of Psychiatrists on the intersection of spirituality and mental health\n• Division or Pluralism?

Cancellations are by request only, and allowed under the following circumstances:\n\nDecember Graduation (or a Fall certification for doctoral students graduating in December).\n\nFormal separation from CMU (i.e. leave of absence, withdrawal, suspension).\n\nFall semester foreign exchange students returning to their university after the Fall semester.\n\nEnrollment in Medicaid in the area in which you are studying (e.g., a Pittsburgh campus student approved for PA Medicaid). Enrollment is based on eligibility and the application process can be lengthy. Students must also have applied for Medicaid before or during their open enrollment period.\n\nThe option to join a new plan does not make a student eligible to cancel their current insurance enrollment.\n\nIf you meet this criterion, contact the Student Health Insurance Team  when your university status has been updated to reflect one of the above statuses (or when you wish to remove a dependent or have been approved for Medicaid). You may be eligible to receive a pro-rated refund of the remaining months' premiums on the student insurance plans in your student account (with adjustment for PhD support, if applicable).\n\nThe final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31, for an April 1 cancellation.

Please review the following details regarding health records, health insurance, and online courses.\n\nAll new students to the Pittsburgh & Silicon Valley campuses must submit required health forms and immunization information, including uploading a CMU Immunization Record Form signed by their healthcare provider before arriving on campus.\n\nStudents should log into HealthConnect and select Medical Clearances to review and submit all required health information. New fall students can access HealthConnect after commencement, in mid-May.\n\nFailure to comply with the below requirements will result in administrative suspension and removal from university housing.\n\nNew students must enter all immunization doses and dates, and upload the CMU Immunization Record Form (signed by a health care provider) in HealthConnect\n\nNew fall semester students must submit immunization information by August 1.\n\nNew spring semester students must submit immunization information by December 1.\n\nMeasles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR)\n\nVaricella (Chickenpox)\n\nMeningococcal AYWC (applies to students living in university housing)\n\nTuberculosis (TB) Screening Form\n\nThe following nearby pharmacies offer Varicella, Meningitis, and MMR vaccines on a walk-in basis and are in-network for CMU SHIP (so the vaccines are fully covered for students with CMU SHIP):\n\nCVS MinuteClinic\n\nGiant Eagle Market District Pharmacy\n\nGiant Eagle Pharmacy\n\nAllegheny County Health Department Immunization Clinic is another local option for vaccines.\n\nAfter commencement, new students can access all of our online forms and upload records in HealthConnect, under Medical Clearances in the left menu.\n\nPlease note: in order to access HealthConnect, your birthdate in the Student Information System (SIO) must be correct. If you are unable to access HealthConnect, check your birthdate in SIO. If it is incorrect, correct it at the HUB. The following day, it should be updated in HealthConnect. If you still have problems, email us for help.\n\nYes, if vaccination is not advised for medical reasons or conflicts with your religious belief/strong moral or ethical conviction. You can find and submit a vaccine exemption form in HealthConnect, under Downloadable Forms, or find them below:\n\nApplication for Personal or Religious Belief Exemption\n\nApplication for Medical Exemption\n\nIf a contagious disease outbreak occurs, the University reserves the right to ask students who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until the outbreak is over.\n\nAll full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. must have medical insurance that meets university requirements; certain programs also require this of their part-time students. Students must fullfil CMU's insurance mandate during their Open Enrollment period.\n\nPrior to a student's Open Enrollment period, a placeholder fee for the CMU Medical SHIP is posted on their student account. This charge is credited back for students who apply for and receive an approved waiver during open enrollment.\n\nThe CMU Student Health Insurance Medical Plan (CMU SHIP) is available to CMU undergraduate and graduate students, and their eligible dependents, during their Open Enrollment period. Optional vision and dental plans are also available.\n\nStudents must enroll in CMU SHIP or apply for a waiver each academic year, during their Open Enrollment period. Students who do not take action to either enroll or waive will be auto-enrolled in the medical CMU SHIP.\n\nAddtional questions?  Review our Common Questions page.\n\nIf You Enroll in the CMU SHIP\n\nThe insurance premium fees will remain on your student account. If you enroll in the vision or dental plans, or add dependents, the additional charges will be posted to your account once the enrollments have been processed.\n\nIf You Apply for a Waiver\n\nIf your current insurance meets university requirements you may apply for a SHIP waiver. If approved, the student insurance charge will be credited back to the your student account.\n\nIf You Take No Action (not recommended)\n\nIf you do not enroll in SHIP, or apply for a waiver, during your Open Enrollment period, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU Medical SHIP, and the insurance premium fee will remain on your student account. And starting in Fall 25, auto-enrollments will also incur a $50 processing fee.\n\nWaiting for this default-enrollment will delay access to your insurance details, so it is not recommended. If you intend to enroll in the student health insurance plan, please complete the steps to enroll during your Open Enrollment period.\n\nHealth and safety are critically important to the student experience, both in and out of the classroom. All new undergraduate students must complete online courses about substance use safety and sexual violence prevention. Incoming undergraduate students will receive access on Canvas on July 15th to two courses: Safer Scotties- Navigating Substance Use and Safer Scotties- Healthy Relationships. Incoming students should complete these courses by August 16th.\n\nHaving issues with the course?

That is why all full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. are required to meet CMU's health insurance mandate each academic year.\n\nTo fulfill this mandate students must have insurance that meets university requirements for the duration of their time as an enrolled student, either through enrolling in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), or obtaining a SHIP waiver:\n\nSHIP Eligibility\n\nAll full-time and part-time degree-seeking Carnegie Mellon students, and their eligible dependents, are eligible to enroll in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) during their Open Enrollment period.  Students can also enroll in the SHIP, or add eligible dependents to their existing SHIP enrollments, outside of Open Enrollment due to a Qualifying Life Event (QLE).\n\nOpen Enrollment is the period during which students must enroll in the CMU SHIP or apply to waive it. SHIP enrollments, and waiver applications, are submitted through the insurance portal in Student Information Online (SIO).\n\nHow to submit and enrollment/waiver during Open Enrollment\n\nStudents who do not take any action to enroll in, or waive, the CMU SHIP during their Open Enrollment period will be auto-enrolled into the CMU SHIP medical plan.\n\nWe strongly recommend that students do not wait to be auto-enrolled:\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• The enroll/waive process must be completed during a student's Open Enrollment period.\n\nSHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n• SHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n• If you do not have insurance that meets university requirements you must enroll in the medical SHIP.\n• By default, a SHIP placeholder charge is posted to your student account, until you complete Open Enrollment.\n• If you do not complete Open Enrollment you will be auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP.  Auto enrollments are not recommended, and beginning in Fall 25 will incur a $50 processing fee.\n\n• SHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n\n• Open Enrollment\n• CMU Insurance Waiver Requirements\n• SHIP Rates\n• SHIP Coverage & Plan Documents\n• Insurance Frequently Asked Questions\n\n• Open Enrollment periods correspond with a student's first active semester at CMU each academic year.\n• Students who do not enroll or waive during their Open Enrollment period are auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP (not recommended).\n• By default, a placeholder charge for the CMU SHIP is posted to each student's account.\n\nDuring Open Enrollment this placeholder charge, and payment of this fee, does not indicate a SHIP enrollment. \nStudents who apply for and receive an approved waiver will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.\nStudents who enroll in the SHIP will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account. The insurance premium fee will then be assessed for the plans they enroll in (medical, dental, and/or vision).\nIf auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP the insurance fee will remain on the account, and beginning in Fall 25 will also incur a $50 processing fee.\n• During Open Enrollment this placeholder charge, and payment of this fee, does not indicate a SHIP enrollment.\n• Students who apply for and receive an approved waiver will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.\n• Students who enroll in the SHIP will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.

Students can only enroll in these optional plans during their Open Enrollment period.\n• Auto-enrollments are processed using the latest U.S. address or campus SMC mailbox listed in SIO.

Therapists are also available to consult with any member of the university community regarding student mental health concerns.\n\nWhat is confidentiality?\n\nRespecting your confidentiality is one of Counseling and Psychological Services’ (CaPS) highest priorities. We maintain confidentiality to the limits provided by Pennsylvania law and FERPA guidelines. In accordance with law, we do not release information to anyone outside of CaPS (including parents, administrators, faculty, or potential employers), or disclose that you have received care, without your explicit permission.\n\nIn most cases, the only information others have about your experiences in therapy is what you choose to tell them yourself. Counseling records, including the scheduling of appointments and content of counseling sessions, are maintained in files completely separate from the student’s academic records and cannot be accessed by faculty, parents, or any non-CaPS staff without your explicit authorization.\n\nIn the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania any individual over the age of 14 has the right to keep treatment private from their parents. If you want CaPS to communicate with family members, faculty/staff, or other providers, you can discuss this with a CaPS clinician and complete a Release of Information Form (ROI).\n\nThere are exceptions to confidentiality. By law we are obligated to disclose personal information without permission in emergency situations where information is needed to protect the safety of someone whose life may be at risk. You can discuss any concerns you have about the limits to confidentiality with your CaPS therapist at any time.\n\nCaPS may contact you by phone, email or voicemail as needed and will ask you, upon your first appointment, your preferred method of contact.\n\nEmail is not a confidential form of communication so we won’t use email to initiate therapeutic conversations. Things we do communicate by email are appointment reminders, reaching out in case of absence, and scheduling purposes.\n\nTo ensure a confidential, safe environment via teletherapy, you will receive a link to a personalized Zoom room from your clinician. Access to this Zoom room is only provided to whomever the clinician allows into the room. For any session, each person's identity and access to safe and confidential spaces are confirmed for each individual present. Clinicians will meet with you from a secure location, with headphones and/or noise canceling sound machines turned on in their spaces so that no other individuals outside of their respective offices may hear the conversations occurring.\n\nYour consent to treatment includes sharing limited information with members of CMU’s University Health Services where necessary to coordinate your medical care and treatment.\n\nIn addition to providing psychological and psychiatric services, CMU CaPS serves as a training clinic. This means that one of our functions is to provide direct clinical experience for graduate students, doctoral interns, post-doctoral fellows and other clinicians working to become fully-licensed psychologists, licensed counselors or to obtain additional credentials.\n\nYour treatment provider may be a therapist-in-training. If that is the case, upon the first meeting, you will be notified of their training status and learn who their supervisor is. You have the choice to change providers if this is not someone who you want to meet with. As part of their training you will be asked if the session can be video recorded, with the purpose of getting feedback by their supervisor regarding their performance. You have the right to deny being recorded or request that the recording device be turned off at any time. Sessions recordings are for supervisory and training purposes only, and are kept on a secure server with access limited only to supervising staff. Any information that you reveal, whether oral or written, will not be discussed or shared with anyone outside of CMU CaPS professional staff without your prior written permission. The recordings are erased promptly after their supervisor provides them with feedback.\n\nPsychiatry service is the only service at CaPS that bills health insurance, and only the student health plan is accepted. For that purpose, we will disclose student medical records to CMU’s Student Health Insurance provider to obtain reimbursement for your health care or to determine eligibility or coverage. Additionally, when billing student accounts, name, date of service and fee are provided to add that to your account. Please know that this, on the student account, is simply labeled as “Student Health Service.” For more information on billing, visit the Psychiatry webpage.\n\nIf you have questions or other concerns about your privacy rights, you may contact the associate director for Clinical Services at CaPS at 412-268-2922.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• To be treated without discrimination and with respect to differences related to race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, personal values, age, disability, and economic or veteran status.\n• To affirm your preferred name and pronouns.\n• To be treated in a courteous and caring manner.\n• To good quality care provided by competent and culturally sensitive professionals and staff.\n• To a private and confidential space for treatment.\n• To receive information you need to participate in decisions about your care, and to give consent before any diagnostic or treatment procedure is performed.\n• To be informed of treatment options available to you.\n• To make informed decisions about your treatment and express your desires to your treating therapist.\n• To include family members in your treatment choices.\n• To decline treatment at any point and to be given information about the consequences of such actions.\n• To review and obtain your treatment records.\n• To ask for and receive an explanation of any charges billed by CMU.\n• To provide feedback to the center regarding their care and treatment experience.\n\n• To provide correct and complete information about their health and past mental health and medical history.\n• To report if they do not understand the planned treatment or their part in the plan.\n• To treat others with respect including CaPS staff, peers in the waiting room, and treating providers.\n• To keep your appointment, or change or cancel it in a timely manner, to allow others in need to have access to treatment.\n• To protect the privacy of staff and other clients by refraining from photography or video / audio recording on CaPS premises.\n• To follow the care, service, or treatment plan developed.\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsiblity\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Professional Training\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• Â© 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• Get Support\n    \n\n                      Support For Yourself\n    \n\n                      For Someone Else\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n• Services\n    \n\n                      Gender Affirming Care\n    \n\n                      Let's Talk\n    \n\n                      Consultation\n    \n\n                      Groups & Skills Clinics\n    \n\n                      Individual Therapy\n    \n\n                      Outreach Prevention & Education\n    \n\n                      Psychiatric Care\n    \n\n                      Referrals\n    \n\n                      Tele-Mental Health\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n• TimelyCare\n• Resources\n• Professional Training\n• Get Involved\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n    \n\n                      Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Contact CaPS\n• About CaPS\n    \n\n                      Frequently Asked Questions\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• CaPS Event D-List Sign Up\n\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2922",

That is why all full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. are required to meet CMU's health insurance mandate each academic year.\n\nTo fulfill this mandate students must have insurance that meets university requirements for the duration of their time as an enrolled student, either through enrolling in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), or obtaining a SHIP waiver:\n\nSHIP Eligibility\n\nAll full-time and part-time degree-seeking Carnegie Mellon students, and their eligible dependents, are eligible to enroll in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) during their Open Enrollment period.  Students can also enroll in the SHIP, or add eligible dependents to their existing SHIP enrollments, outside of Open Enrollment due to a Qualifying Life Event (QLE).\n\nOpen Enrollment is the period during which students must enroll in the CMU SHIP or apply to waive it. SHIP enrollments, and waiver applications, are submitted through the insurance portal in Student Information Online (SIO).\n\nHow to submit and enrollment/waiver during Open Enrollment\n\nStudents who do not take any action to enroll in, or waive, the CMU SHIP during their Open Enrollment period will be auto-enrolled into the CMU SHIP medical plan.\n\nWe strongly recommend that students do not wait to be auto-enrolled:\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• The enroll/waive process must be completed during a student's Open Enrollment period.\n\nSHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n• SHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n• If you do not have insurance that meets university requirements you must enroll in the medical SHIP.\n• By default, a SHIP placeholder charge is posted to your student account, until you complete Open Enrollment.\n• If you do not complete Open Enrollment you will be auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP.  Auto enrollments are not recommended, and beginning in Fall 25 will incur a $50 processing fee.\n\n• SHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n\n• Open Enrollment\n• CMU Insurance Waiver Requirements\n• SHIP Rates\n• SHIP Coverage & Plan Documents\n• Insurance Frequently Asked Questions\n\n• Open Enrollment periods correspond with a student's first active semester at CMU each academic year.\n• Students who do not enroll or waive during their Open Enrollment period are auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP (not recommended).\n• By default, a placeholder charge for the CMU SHIP is posted to each student's account.\n\nDuring Open Enrollment this placeholder charge, and payment of this fee, does not indicate a SHIP enrollment. \nStudents who apply for and receive an approved waiver will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.\nStudents who enroll in the SHIP will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account. The insurance premium fee will then be assessed for the plans they enroll in (medical, dental, and/or vision).\nIf auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP the insurance fee will remain on the account, and beginning in Fall 25 will also incur a $50 processing fee.\n• During Open Enrollment this placeholder charge, and payment of this fee, does not indicate a SHIP enrollment.\n• Students who apply for and receive an approved waiver will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.\n• Students who enroll in the SHIP will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.

When you or a covered family member needs certain medical\nservices, including:\nl Primary care provider office visits\nl Specialist office visits\nl Physical, speech and occupational therapy\nl Diagnostic services\nl Inpatient and outpatient hospital services\nl Home health or hospice care\nNetwork Care\n*NTOCLVL2*Network Care*TOCLVL2* etwork care is care you receive from providers in your program's network.\nWhen you receive health care within the network, you enjoy maximum coverage and maximum convenience.\nYou present your ID card to the provider who submits your claim.\nOut-of-Network Care\n*OTOCLVL2*Out-of-Network Care*TOCLVL2* ut-of-network care is care you receive from providers who are not in your program's network.\nOut-of-network providers are not in the program's network. When using out-of-network providers, you may still\nhave coverage for most eligible services, except you will share more financial and paperwork responsibilities.\nIn addition, you may be responsible for paying any differences between the program's payments and the\nprovider's actual charges. Finally, you may need to file your own claims and obtain precertification for inpatient\ncare. You should always check with the provider before getting care to understand at what level your care will\nbe covered.\nRemember: If you want to enjoy maximum benefits coverage, you need to be sure you receive care\nfrom a network provider. See the Summary of Benefits for your coverage details.\nEven though a hospital may be in our network, not every doctor providing services in that hospital is in\nthe network. For example: If you are having surgery, make sure that all of your providers, including\nsurgeons, anesthesiologists and radiologists, are in the network.\nOut-of-Area Care\n*YTOCLVL2*Out-of-Area Care*TOCLVL2* our program also provides coverage for you and your eligible dependents when you receive care from\nproviders located outside of Pennsylvania. For specific details, see the Inter-Plan Arrangements section of this\ncertificate.\nIf you are traveling and an urgent injury or illness occurs, you should seek treatment from the nearest hospital,\nemergency room or clinic: If the treatment results in an admission the provider must obtain precertification from\nHighmark. However, it is important that you confirm Highmark's determination of medical necessity and\nappropriateness. If precertification is not obtained and the admission is not considered to be medically\nCERT-STU-2024\n42\n\nnecessary and appropriate, you will be responsible for all costs associated with the stay. For specific details,\nsee the Health Care Management section of this certificate.\nProvider Reimbursement and Member Liability\n*HTOCLVL2*Provider Reimbursement and Member Liability*TOCLVL2* ighmark uses the Plan Allowance to calculate the benefit payable and the financial liability of the member for\nMedically Necessary and Appropriate Services covered under this plan. Refer to the Terms You Should Know\nsection for the definition of Plan Allowance.\nHighmark's payment is determined by first subtracting any deductible and/or copayment liability from the Plan\nAllowance. The coinsurance percentage set forth in the Summary of Benefits is then applied to that amount.\nThis amount represents Highmark's payment. Any remaining coinsurance amount is the member's\nresponsibility. The member's total cost-sharing liability is the sum of the coinsurance plus any deductible\nand/or copayment obligations.\nWhen a member receives covered services from an out-of-network provider, in addition to the member's\ncost-sharing liability described above, the member is responsible for the difference between Highmark's\npayment and the provider's billed charge. If a member receives services which are not covered under this plan,\nthe member is responsible for all charges associated with those services.\nHowever, the following covered services when received from an out-of-network provider will be provided at the\nnetwork services level of benefits and you will not be responsible for such difference:\n1. Emergency care services; and\n2. Ambulance services, when provided in conjunction with emergency care services or when provided by\nair.\nAdditionally, in very limited circumstances, you may not be liable for charges for non-emergency covered\nservices received from certain professional providers or ancillary providers who are not part of the network.\nWhen you are a patient at a network facilty provider, a professional provider or ancillary provider who is not\npart of the network may render certain items and professional services (such as, but not limited to\nconsultations, equipment, devices, anesthesiology, radiology or pathology services) to you. The selection of\nsuch professional providers or ancillary providers may be beyond your control. In that situation, you will not be\nliable, except for applicable network deductible, copayment or coinsurance obligations, for the charges of the\nprofessional provider or ancillary provider.\nInter-Plan Arrangements\n*OTOCLVL2*Inter-Plan Arrangements*TOCLVL2* ut-of-Area Services\nHighmark has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees referred to\ngenerally as \"inter-plan arrangements.\" These inter-plan arrangements operate under rules and procedures\nissued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Whenever members access health care services outside of\nPennsylvania, the claim for those services may be processed through one of these inter-plan arrangements, as\ndescribed generally below.\nTypically, when accessing care outside of Pennsylvania, members obtain care from providers that have a\ncontractual agreement (\"participating providers\") with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that\nother geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). In some instances, members may obtain care from providers in the Host\nBlue geographic area that do not have a contractual agreement (\"non-participating providers\") with the Host\nBlue. Highmark remains responsible for fulfilling our contractual obligations to you. Highmark's payment\npractices in both instances are described below.\nCERT-STU-2024\n43\n\nBlueCard® Program\nThe BlueCard® Program is an inter-plan arrangement. Under this arrangement, when members access\ncovered services outside of Pennsylvania, the Host Blue will be responsible for contracting and handling all\ninteractions with its participating health care providers.\nThe financial terms of the BlueCard Program are described generally below.\nLiability Calculation Method per Claim\nUnless subject to a fixed dollar copayment, the calculation of the member liability on claims for covered\nservices processed through the BlueCard Program will be based on the lower of the participating provider's\nbilled charges for covered services or the negotiated price made available to Highmark by the Host Blue.\nHost Blues determine a negotiated price, which is reflected in the terms of each Host Blue's health care\nprovider contracts. The negotiated price made available to Highmark by the Host Blue may be represented by\none of the following:\nl an actual price - An actual price is a negotiated rate of payment in effect at the time a claim is processed\nwithout any other increases or decreases, or\nl an estimated price - An estimated price is a negotiated rate of payment in effect at the time a claim is\nprocessed, reduced or increased by a percentage to take into account certain payments negotiated with\nthe provider and other claim- and non-claim-related transactions. Such transactions may include, but are\nnot limited to, anti-fraud and abuse recoveries, provider refunds not applied on a claim-specific basis,\nretrospective settlements and performance-related bonuses or incentives, or\nl an average price - An average price is a percentage of billed charges for covered services in effect at the\ntime a claim is processed representing the aggregate payments negotiated by the Host Blue with all of its\nproviders or a similar classification of its providers and other claim- and non-claim-related transactions.\nSuch transactions may include the same ones as noted above for an estimated price.\nHost Blues determine whether or not they will use an actual price, estimated or average price. Host Blues\nusing either an estimated price or an average price may prospectively increase or reduce such prices to\ncorrect for over- or underestimation of past prices, (i.e., prospective adjustment may mean that a current price\nreflects additional amounts or credits for claims already paid or anticipated to be paid to providers or refunds\nreceived or anticipated to be received from providers). However, the BlueCard Program requires that the\namount paid by the member is a final price; no future price adjustment will result in increases or decreases to\nthe pricing of past claims. The method of claims payment by Host Blues is taken into account by Highmark in\ndetermining the member's premiums.\nSpecial Cases: Value-Based Programs\nHighmark has included a factor for bulk distributions from Host Blues in your premium for Value-Based\nPrograms when applicable under your program. Additional information is available upon request.\nReturn of Overpayments\nRecoveries of overpayments from a Host Blue or its participating and non-participating providers can arise in\nseveral ways, including, but not limited to, anti-fraud and abuse recoveries, provider/hospital bill audits, credit\nbalance audits, utilization review refunds and unsolicited refunds. Recoveries will be applied so that corrections\nwill be made, in general, on either a claim-by-claim or prospective basis. If recovery amounts are passed on a\nclaim-by-claim basis from a Host Blue to Highmark, they will be credited to your account. In some cases, the\nHost Blue will engage a third party to assist in identification or collection of overpayments. The fees of such a\nthird party may be charged to you as a percentage of the recovery.\nCERT-STU-2024\n44\n\nInter-Plan Programs: Federal State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees\nIn some instances, federal or state laws or regulations may impose a surcharge, tax or other fee that applies to\ninsured accounts. If applicable, Highmark will include any such surcharge, tax or other fee in determining your\npremium.\nNon-Participating Providers Outside Pennsylvania\nMember Liability Calculation\nWhen covered services are provided outside Pennsylvania by non-participating providers, the amount(s) a\nmember pays for such services will generally be based on either the Host Blue's non-participating provider\nlocal payment or the pricing arrangements required by applicable law. In these situations, the member may be\nresponsible for the difference between the amount that the non-participating provider bills and the payment\nHighmark will make for the covered services as set forth in this paragraph. Payments for emergency services\nrendered by non-participating providers will be governed by applicable federal and state law.\nExceptions\nIn some exception cases, Highmark may pay claims from non-participating providers outside Pennsylvania\nbased on the provider's billed charge. This may occur in situations where a Member did not have reasonable\naccess to the participating provider, as determined by Highmark in Highmark's sole and absolute discretion or\nby applicable law. In other exception cases, Highmark may pay such claims based on the payment Highmark\nwould make if Highmark were paying a non-participating provider for the same covered service inside the Plan\nService Area as described elsewhere in this document. This may occur where the Host Blue's corresponding\npayment would be more than the plan in-service area non-participating provider payment. Highmark may\nchoose to negotiate a payment with such a provider on an exception basis.\nUnless otherwise stated, in any of these exception situations, the Member may be responsible for the\ndifference between the amount that the non-participating provider bills and payment Highmark will make for the\ncovered services as set forth in this paragraph.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program\nIf members are outside the United States (hereinafter \"BlueCard service area\"), they may be able to take\nadvantage of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program when accessing covered services. The Blue\nCross Blue Shield Global Core Program is unlike the BlueCard Program available in the BlueCard service area\nin certain ways. For instance, although the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program assists members with\naccessing a network of inpatient, outpatient and professional providers, the network is not served by a Host\nBlue. As such, when members receive care from providers outside the BlueCard service area, they will\ntypically have to pay the providers and submit the claims themselves to obtain reimbursement for these\nservices.\nInpatient Services\nIn most cases, if members contact the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core service center (\"service center\") for\nassistance, hospitals will not require members to pay for inpatient covered services, except for their\ncost-sharing amounts. In such cases, a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core contracting hospital will submit\nmember claims to the service center to initiate claims processing. However, if the member paid in full at the\ntime of service, the member must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement for covered services. Members\nmust contact Highmark to obtain precertification or preauthorization for non-emergency inpatient\nservices.\nOutpatient Services\nPhysicians, urgent care centers and other outpatient providers located outside the BlueCard service area will\ntypically require members to pay in full at the time of service. Members must submit a claim to obtain\nreimbursement for covered services.\nCERT-STU-2024\n45\n\nSubmitting a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Claim\nWhen members pay for covered services outside the BlueCard service area, they must submit a claim to\nobtain reimbursement. For institutional and professional claims, members should complete a Blue Cross Blue\nShield Global Core International claim form and send the claim form with the provider's itemized bill(s) to the\nservice center address on the form to initiate claims processing.

For purposes of this subsection, active\ncourse of treatment means;\n1. an ongoing course of treatment for a life-threatening condition, defined as a disease or condition for\nwhich likelihood of death is probable unless the course of the disease or condition is interrupted;\n2. an ongoing course of treatment for a serious acute condition, defined as a disease or condition\nrequiring specialized medical treatment to avoid the reasonable possibility of death or permanent\nharm or complex ongoing care which you are currently receiving, such as chemotherapy, radiation\ntherapy or post-operative visits;\n3. confirmed pregnancy, through the postpartum period;\n4. scheduled non-elective surgery, through post-operative care;\n5. an ongoing course of treatment for a health condition that is life-threatening, degenerative,\npotentially disabling or congenital and that requires specialized medical care over a prolonged\nperiod of time or for which a treating physician or health care provider attests that discontinuing\ncare by that physician or health care provider would worsen the condition or interfere with\nanticipated outcomes; or\n6. treatment for a terminal illness.\nIf, however, the network provider is terminated for cause and you continue to seek treatment from that\nprovider, Highmark will not be liable for payment for health care services provided to you following the date of\ntermination.\nCERT-STU-2024\n50\n\nAny services authorized under this subsection will be covered in accordance with the same terms and\nconditions as applicable to a network provider. Nothing in this subsection shall require Highmark to pay\nbenefits for health care services that are not otherwise provided herein.\nTransition of Care\nIf you are receiving medical care from an out-of-network provider, which is not otherwise covered by prior\ncoverage, at the time when your coverage under this Certificate begins, you may opt to continue an ongoing\ncourse of treatment with that provider for a period of up to sixty (60) days. However, if you are in the second or\nthird trimester of pregnancy when this coverage begins, the transition of care period shall extend through\npostpartum care related to the delivery.

If the admission is\ndetermined not to be medically necessary and appropriate, you will be held harmless, except when Highmark\nprovides prior written notice to you that the admission will not be covered. In such case, you will be financially\nresponsible for charges for that admission.\nOut-of-Area Network Care\nIn the event of a proposed inpatient stay for other than an emergency admission to a network facility provider\nlocated out-of-area, the facility will contact Highmark prior to the proposed admission, or within 48 hours or as\nsoon as reasonably possible after an emergency admission, to obtain precertification for the admission. You\nare also responsible for contacting Highmark at the toll-free number listed on the back of your ID card to\nconfirm Highmark's determination of medical necessity and appropriateness.\nIf precertification for a medically necessary and appropriate inpatient admission has been obtained, benefits for\ncovered services will be provided. If a network facility does not contact Highmark for precertification, the\ninpatient admission will be reviewed for medical necessity and appropriateness. It is important that you\nconfirm Highmark's determination of medical necessity and appropriateness. If your admission is\ndetermined not to be medically necessary and appropriate, you will be responsible for the full amount\nof the network facility provider's charge.\nIf you elect to be admitted after receiving written notification from Highmark that any portion of the proposed\nadmission is not medically necessary and appropriate, you will be financially responsible for all charges\nassociated with that portion of care.

You may, therefore, receive services which are not medically\nnecessary and appropriate for which you will be solely responsible.\nOut-of-Network Care\nIn the event of a proposed inpatient stay for other than an emergency admission to an out-of-network facility\nprovider, you are responsible for notifying Highmark prior to your proposed admission or within 48 hours or\nas soon as reasonably possible after an emergency admission. However, some facility providers will contact\nHighmark and obtain precertification of the inpatient admission on your behalf. Be sure to verify that your\nprovider is contacting Highmark for precertification. If not, you are responsible for contacting Highmark.\nIf precertification for a medically necessary and appropriate inpatient admission has been obtained, benefits for\ncovered services will be provided.

In addition, Highmark\nassists hospitals with discharge planning. These activities are conducted by a Highmark nurse working with a\nmedical director. Here is a brief description of these review procedures:\nProspective Review\nProspective review, also known as precertification or pre-service review, begins upon receipt of treatment\ninformation. Upon receipt and review of a precertification request from a provider, if Highmark determines that\ninformation is missing that is needed in order to make a decision, Highmark will notify the requesting provider\nthat the information is missing. Highmark will identify the missing information with enough specificity so that the\nprovider can submit the information needed to Highmark.\nAfter receiving the request for care, Highmark:\nl verifies your eligibility for coverage and availability of benefits;\nl reviews diagnosis and plan of treatment;\nl assesses whether care is medically necessary and appropriate;\nl makes a decision regarding the request, and if approved, authorizes care and assigns an\nappropriate length of stay for inpatient admissions.\nCERT-STU-2024\n52\n\nIn making a decision regarding the precertification request, Highmark will consider medical policies,\nadministrative policies, your relevant medical information, and medical or scientific evidence submitted by your\nprovider.\nConcurrent Review\nConcurrent review may occur during the course of ongoing treatment and is used to assess the medical\nnecessity and appropriateness of the length of stay and level of care. At the time of the review, Highmark will\nverify your eligibility for coverage and availability of benefits and assess whether the care is medically\nnecessary and appropriate. In making a decision, Highmark will consider its medical policies, administrative\npolicies, your relevant medical information, and medical or scientific evidence submitted by your provider.\nDischarge Planning\nDischarge planning is a process that begins prior to your scheduled hospital admission. Working with you, your\nfamily, your attending physician(s) and hospital staff, Highmark will help plan for and coordinate your discharge\nto assure that you receive safe and uninterrupted care when needed at the time of discharge.\nOutpatient Procedure or Covered Service Precertification\nPrecertification may be required to determine the medical necessity and appropriateness of certain outpatient\nprocedures or covered services as determined by Highmark prior to the receipt of services.\nIn-Area Network Care\nNetwork providers are responsible for the precertification of such procedure or covered service and you will not\nbe financially responsible whenever certification for such procedure or covered service is not obtained by the\nnetwork provider. If the procedure or covered service is deemed not to be medically necessary and\nappropriate, you will not be financially responsible, except when Highmark provides prior written notice to you\nthat charges for the procedure or covered service will not be covered. In such case, you will be financially\nresponsible for such procedure or covered service.\nOut-of-Area Care\nWhenever you utilize a network provider located out-of-area, it is your responsibility to first contact Highmark to\nconfirm the medical necessity and appropriateness of such procedure or covered service. If you do not contact\nHighmark for certification, that procedure or covered service may be reviewed after it is received to determine\nmedical necessity and appropriateness. If the procedure or covered service is determined to be medically\nnecessary and appropriate, benefits will be paid in accordance with the plan. If the procedure or covered\nservice is determined not to be medically necessary and appropriate, no benefits will be provided. In such case\nyou will be financially responsible for the full amount of the charge of the network provider located out-of-area.\nOut-of-Network Care\nWhenever you utilize an out-of-network provider, it is your responsibility to first contact Highmark to confirm the\nmedical necessity and appropriateness and/or obtain precertification of such procedure or covered service. If\nyou do not contact Highmark for precertification, that procedure or covered service may be reviewed after it is\nreceived to determine medical necessity and appropriateness. If the procedure or covered service is\ndetermined to be medically necessary and appropriate, benefits will be paid in accordance with the plan. You\nwill be financially responsible for the difference between what is covered by the plan and the full amount of the\nout-of-network provider's charge. If such procedure or covered service is determined not to be medically\nnecessary and appropriate, no benefits will be provided. In such case, you will be financially responsible for the\nfull amount of the out-of-network provider's charge.\nIf you have any questions regarding procedures and services subject to precertification or Highmark's\nprecertification determination of a procedure or service for medical necessity and appropriateness of certain\nCERT-STU-2024\n53\n\noutpatient procedures or covered services, you can contact Highmark via the toll-free Member Service\ntelephone number located on the back of your ID card or check the member website.\nRetrospective Review\nRetrospective review may occur when a service or procedure has been rendered without the required\nprecertification.\nCase Management Services\nCase Management is a voluntary program in which a case manager, with input from you and your health care\nproviders, assists when you are facing and/or recovering from a hospital admission, dealing with multiple\nmedical problems or facing catastrophic needs. Highmark case managers can provide educational support,\nassist in coordinating needed health care services, put you in touch with community resources, assist in\naddressing obstacles to your recovery such as benefit and caregiver issues and answer your questions.\nIndividual Case and Care Management\nHighmark shall provide such alternative benefits, in its sole discretion, only when, and for so long as, it\ndetermines that the services are medically necessary and appropriate, cost effective, and that the total benefits\npaid for such procedures/services do not exceed the total benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled to.\nHighmark, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit access and/or modify benefit(s), regardless of the\ndisease or condition, when Highmark identifies utilization patterns that could potentially result in harm to you or\nthe public.\nYou can call and request case management services if you feel you need it by contacting Member Services at\nthe telephone number listed on the back of your ID card.\nHealth Improvement Services and Support\nFrom time to time, Highmark may directly or indirectly make available to you information and access to\nnon-medical items, services and support programs designed to address underlying social and environmental\nfactors that may negatively impact your health status. The provision of such information, items, services, and\nsupport programs shall not alter the benefits provided under this program.\nSelection of Providers\nYou have the option of choosing where and from whom to receive covered services. You may utilize a network\nprovider or an out-of-network provider. However, covered services received from a network provider are\nusually provided at a higher level of benefits than those received from an out-of-network provider and certain\nnon-emergency services may only be covered when rendered by a network provider. Please note that benefits\nfor covered telemedicine services are only provided when such services are rendered by a designated\ntelemedicine provider.\nIn the event you require non-emergency covered services that are not available within the network, Highmark\nmay refer you to an out-of-network provider. You must notify Highmark prior to receiving a covered service\nfrom an out-of-network provider in order for Highmark to facilitate this arrangement. In such cases, services will\nbe covered at the n etwork level so that you will not be responsible for any greater out-of-pocket amount than if\nservices had been rendered by a network provider. You will not be responsible for any difference between\nHighmark's payment and the out-of-network provider's billed charge.\nCERT-STU-2024\n54\n\nPrescription Drug Management\n*YTOCLVL2*Prescription Drug Management*TOCLVL2* our prescription drug program provides the following provisions which will determine the medical necessity\nand appropriateness of covered medications and supplies.\nEarly Refill\nExcept for the purposes of Medication Synchronization and refills of covered medications that are eyedrops, no\ncoverage is provided for any refill of a covered medication that is dispensed before your predicted use of at\nleast 75% of the days' supply of the previously dispensed covered medication, unless your physician obtains\nprecertification from Highmark for an earlier refill.\nCoverage for refills of covered medications shall be provided for any refill dispensed between either:\nl twenty-one (21) and thirty (30) days (for 30-day supply);\nl forty-two (42) and sixty (60) days (for 60-day supply); or\nl sixty-three (63) and ninety (90) days (for 90-day supply)\nafter the date on which the Member received the original prescription or the most recent refill.\nUnexpected Event\nIf your prescription is lost or stolen due to an event such as a fire or theft, you may be able to get an early\nrefill.

These programs are designed to help you maintain good health, manage chronic\nconditions or special health care needs and reduce risk factors. Such care management programs may include\nthe provision of devices or durable medical equipment at no additional cost to you. Participation in select\nprograms is voluntary and Highmark reserves the right to modify or discontinue any such program at any time.\nHighmark, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit access and/or modify benefit(s), regardless of the\ndisease or condition, when Highmark identifies utilization patterns that could potentially result in harm to you or\nthe public.\nQuantity Level Limits\nQuantity level limits may be imposed on certain prescription drugs by Highmark.

If you graduate in December, you can be seen at Health Services up until our winter holiday closure.\n\nIf you are in Pittsburgh after that time and need services, we can help you find local providers for your health care needs.\n\nYou have that coverage until July 31. This is a national plan and can be used in any state at any facility that accepts the insurance plan.\n\nIf you have an offer for employer-sponsored medical insurance, you are not required to cancel the CMU student medical insurance plan. You have the option to tell your employer that you have medical insurance in effect through July 31. The employer can then help you enroll in their plan effective August 1 because you would then have a loss of coverage (which is considered a qualifying life event for enrollment into a medical insurance plan outside of that plan's Open Enrollment period).\n\nWe strongly recommend comparing the student insurance plan with the one being offered by the employer. Pay close attention to not only the premiums, but deductible of the plans, co-pays, co-insurance, and the list of benefits offered.\n\nImmunization records, test results, statements and after-visit summaries are all available to download/print from HealthConnect. Current students and recent graduates (within 90 days) can request additional medical records by using \"Messages\" in HEALTHCONNECT.\n\nIf you are taking a leave or planning to withdraw, you can be seen at Health Services up until the date that your leave becomes effective. If you are in Pittsburgh after that time and need services, we can help you find local providers for your health care needs.\n\nIf you purchased the CMU student health insurance plan, you will have that coverage until July 31, as long as you were an actively enrolled student for at least the first 31 days from the first day of classes. This is a national plan and can be used with any health care provider/facility that accepts the plan.\n\nYou must be an actively enrolled student for at least the first 31 days from the start date of classes to remain enrolled in the CMU SHIP. If you separate from the university before completing the first 31 days of classes, the insurance plan/s you enrolled in will be canceled, effective the first day of the month following your separation date (or retroactively to August 1 if you request this).  If you leave after 31 days, you can choose to keep the policy you purchased through July 31 or cancel the policy and obtain a prorated refund.\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• Former students who no longer have access to HealthConnect must submit a Consent for Release of Medical Information Form (pdf).\n• Please note that UHS maintains patient records for 10 years; we are unable to provide records beyond 10 years.\n• Students who received care at Counseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) must contact CaPS directly to request mental health records, at 412-268-2922.\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsibility\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\n• Disability Resources\n• Title IX Initiatives\n• University Police\n• University Policies\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• © 2024 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Facebook\n• CMU on Twitter\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• HealthConnect\n• New Students\n• Family & Parents\n• Student Insurance\n    \n\n                      Enroll in the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Waive the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Change or Cancel the SHIP\n    \n\n                      SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n    \n\n                      SHIP Rates & Billing\n    \n\n                      Using the SHIP\n    \n\n                      International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n    \n\n                      Insurance Literacy\n    \n\n                      Contacts & Common Questions\n    \n\n                      Leaving CMU\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n• Services & Fees\n    \n\n                      COVID19 \n    \n\n                      Sexual Assault Resources\n    \n\n                      LGBTQIA+ Health\n    \n\n                      Sexual Health\n    \n\n                      Allergy Injections\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n• Health Education & Resources\n    \n\n                      Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n    \n\n                      Local Healthcare Resources\n    \n\n                      Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n    \n\n\n\n                      Recovery and Harm Reduction\n    \n\n                      Wellness To Go Machines\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n• About Us\n    \n\n                      UHS News\n    \n\n                      Who We Are\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n\n• Information for PHAs\n\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2922\nPhone: 412-268-2157",

Please review the following details regarding health records, health insurance, and online courses.\n\nAll new students to the Pittsburgh & Silicon Valley campuses must submit required health forms and immunization information, including uploading a CMU Immunization Record Form signed by their healthcare provider before arriving on campus.\n\nStudents should log into HealthConnect and select Medical Clearances to review and submit all required health information. New fall students can access HealthConnect after commencement, in mid-May.\n\nFailure to comply with the below requirements will result in administrative suspension and removal from university housing.\n\nNew students must enter all immunization doses and dates, and upload the CMU Immunization Record Form (signed by a health care provider) in HealthConnect\n\nNew fall semester students must submit immunization information by August 1.\n\nNew spring semester students must submit immunization information by December 1.\n\nMeasles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR)\n\nVaricella (Chickenpox)\n\nMeningococcal AYWC (applies to students living in university housing)\n\nTuberculosis (TB) Screening Form\n\nThe following nearby pharmacies offer Varicella, Meningitis, and MMR vaccines on a walk-in basis and are in-network for CMU SHIP (so the vaccines are fully covered for students with CMU SHIP):\n\nCVS MinuteClinic\n\nGiant Eagle Market District Pharmacy\n\nGiant Eagle Pharmacy\n\nAllegheny County Health Department Immunization Clinic is another local option for vaccines.\n\nAfter commencement, new students can access all of our online forms and upload records in HealthConnect, under Medical Clearances in the left menu.\n\nPlease note: in order to access HealthConnect, your birthdate in the Student Information System (SIO) must be correct. If you are unable to access HealthConnect, check your birthdate in SIO. If it is incorrect, correct it at the HUB. The following day, it should be updated in HealthConnect. If you still have problems, email us for help.\n\nYes, if vaccination is not advised for medical reasons or conflicts with your religious belief/strong moral or ethical conviction. You can find and submit a vaccine exemption form in HealthConnect, under Downloadable Forms, or find them below:\n\nApplication for Personal or Religious Belief Exemption\n\nApplication for Medical Exemption\n\nIf a contagious disease outbreak occurs, the University reserves the right to ask students who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until the outbreak is over.\n\nAll full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. must have medical insurance that meets university requirements; certain programs also require this of their part-time students. Students must fullfil CMU's insurance mandate during their Open Enrollment period.\n\nPrior to a student's Open Enrollment period, a placeholder fee for the CMU Medical SHIP is posted on their student account. This charge is credited back for students who apply for and receive an approved waiver during open enrollment.\n\nThe CMU Student Health Insurance Medical Plan (CMU SHIP) is available to CMU undergraduate and graduate students, and their eligible dependents, during their Open Enrollment period. Optional vision and dental plans are also available.\n\nStudents must enroll in CMU SHIP or apply for a waiver each academic year, during their Open Enrollment period. Students who do not take action to either enroll or waive will be auto-enrolled in the medical CMU SHIP.\n\nAddtional questions?  Review our Common Questions page.\n\nIf You Enroll in the CMU SHIP\n\nThe insurance premium fees will remain on your student account. If you enroll in the vision or dental plans, or add dependents, the additional charges will be posted to your account once the enrollments have been processed.\n\nIf You Apply for a Waiver\n\nIf your current insurance meets university requirements you may apply for a SHIP waiver. If approved, the student insurance charge will be credited back to the your student account.\n\nIf You Take No Action (not recommended)\n\nIf you do not enroll in SHIP, or apply for a waiver, during your Open Enrollment period, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU Medical SHIP, and the insurance premium fee will remain on your student account. And starting in Fall 25, auto-enrollments will also incur a $50 processing fee.\n\nWaiting for this default-enrollment will delay access to your insurance details, so it is not recommended. If you intend to enroll in the student health insurance plan, please complete the steps to enroll during your Open Enrollment period.\n\nHealth and safety are critically important to the student experience, both in and out of the classroom. All new undergraduate students must complete online courses about substance use safety and sexual violence prevention. Incoming undergraduate students will receive access on Canvas on July 15th to two courses: Safer Scotties- Navigating Substance Use and Safer Scotties- Healthy Relationships. Incoming students should complete these courses by August 16th.\n\nHaving issues with the course?

Am I enrolled in the SHIP?\n\n[H2] Additional Common Questions\n\n[H2] I need my insurance ID card. Where can I find my insurance information?\n\n[H2] I do not have a U.S. mailing address yet. Can I enroll in the SHIP?\n\n[H2] If I am graduating in December, can I enroll in the SHIP for August - December only?  Can I enroll only for the months I am on campus?\n\n[H2] I no longer want my student insurance plan/s. Can I cancel the SHIP?\n\n[H2] Outside of Open Enrollment, can I enroll in the medical, dental or vision plans? What if I want to add or remove someone from my plan?\n\n[H2] How do I find in-network health care providers? What if I need to see a doctor or fill a prescription while I am away from campus?\n\n[H2] I am graduating in August. Can I enroll in the SHIP for only the month of August?\n\n[H2] Can I extend the SHIP after graduating in May?\n\n[H2] Why did Highmark send me a letter asking for my Social Security or Tax ID number?\n\n[H3] Mental Health Providers:\n\n[H3] Medical Coverage While Abroad:\n\nSHIP enrollment or waiver status:\n\nQuestions about SHIP coverage (medical procedures, medication, etc.):\n\nQuestions about insurance fees on your student account:\n\nTo update your name, gender, birthdate or mailing address with Highmark:\n\nDepending on the treatment you received, you may have a copay and/or an amount not covered by the insurance plan. The bill from the medical provider will show the charges for the treatment, what your insurance plan has paid and what you owe.\n\nTo start, it is helpful to review the SHIP's Medical Plan Coverage Table, as well as some common insurance terms, in order to better understand what services are covered under the plan.  It is also important to register with Highmark where you can track your medical claims and access your Explanations of Benefits (EOB). The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.\n\nUniversity Health Services (UHS) Charges:\n\nIf you are enrolled in the SHIP and receive care at University Health Services (UHS), many of the fees for our services will be covered by the plan.  If you do owe any fees, those charges will be posted to your student account.\n\nBills from off-campus providers:\n\nIf you see a provider or have a hospital visit outside of UHS, you may receive a bill for non-covered services, and/or copays:\n\nLaboratory Testing:\n\nBills for Ambulance Transport:\n\nThe SHIP covers the cost of emergency ambulance transports, however students are responsible for paying the transport company directly. Highmark will mail you a check for the amount of the transport, once it arrives you have two options:\n\nIf you receive a medical bill and still need assistance, please message the Student Health Insurance Team through HealthConnect, and include a copy of your bill and Explanation of Benefits, if available.\n\nWisdom teeth (third molar) removal is covered under the SHIP Dental Plan and Medical Plan. However, coverage will depend on whether your teeth are soft tissue impacted, or bony impacted.\n\nDental Plan Coverage:\n\nThe SHIP Dental Plan provides benefits for both bony impacted, and soft tissue impacted, wisdom teeth:\n\nYou can review the coverage for third molar removal on the summary of benefits and coverage, located on page 27 of the dental plan book.\n\nMedical Plan Coverage:\n\nThe SHIP Medical Plan only provides benefits for impacted wisdom teeth when partially or totally covered by bone:\n\nYou can review the coverage for third molar removal on page 26 of the medical plan book.\n\nEvaluations & Procedures\n\nBefore having your wisdom teeth removed, you will need to be evaluated. If you have both the SHIP dental plan and medical plan you can get an evaluation from a dentist, or oral surgeon.\n\nThe CMU Medical SHIP provides dental and vision services for students, and their eligible dependents, under the age of 19. This coverage is seperate from the optional dental and vision plans.\n\nPediatric Dental Benefits\n\nPediatric Vision Benefits\n\nClaim forms can be found in the Highmark forms library. Once you have selected the proper form, click the Tips icon for instructions on how to file the claim.\n\nYou can track your claims on your Highmark portal, or call Highmark Member Services with any claim related questions: 800-241-5704.\n\nIf you have the SHIP, prescription drugs are covered, with a copay, at in-network pharmacies. However, prescription drug costs vary according to the drug type (generic, brand-name and specialty), and their corresponding tier levels (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.). Lower tiers (generic) usually have lower copays, while higher tiers (brand-name and specialty) have higher copays.\n\nEnrollments and waivers do not carry over from one academic year to the next; completing Open Enrollment is an annual requirement. Students must enroll in, or waive, the CMU SHIP every academic year that they are enrolled at the university.\n\nAt the start of each academic year, all full-time students (and some part-time students) enrolled in a degree-seeking program are assessed a placeholder charge for the CMU Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). This placeholder charge remains on a student's account until they complete Open Enrollment.\n\nIf you do not complete Open Enrollment, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU Medical SHIP and the insurance fee will remain on your student account.\n\nIf you receive an approved waiver, the insurance fee will be credited back to your student account.\n\nPlease note that invoices are generated on the first day of each month. Please check the Account Activity page in SIO for up-to-date charges and credits.\n\nStudent account or invoice questions should be directed to Student Financial Services.\n\nNo, the insurance fee posted on a student's account is a placeholder charge, and paying the insurance fee does not complete your SHIP enrollment.\n\nStudents must submit a SHIP enrollment during their Open Enrollment period:\n\nInsurance ID cards should arrive 2-3 weeks after your enrollment has been processed. If you are need of your member ID number before your card arrives:\n\nA U.S. mailing address is required to enroll in the CMU SHIP. Enrollments submitted with a non-U.S. address, or an incomplete address, will not be processed.\n\nInternational students enrolling in the CMU SHIP should wait until they have secured a U.S. mailing address where they can receive mail before submitting an enrollment. Waiting until later in the Open Enrollment period to enroll in the SHIP will not affect the coverage dates. SHIP coverage begins on August 1 each academic year, even if you do not submit your enrollment until the end of the Open Enrollment period.\n\nThe CMU SHIP is a full year plan with a coverage period of August 1 - July 31 each academic year. Students entering CMU in the Fall are enrolled and charged for the full coverage year.\n\nStudents graduating in December can request to cancel the SHIP at that time; it does not cancel automatically. Students with an approved cancellation will receive a prorated refund of the remaining months' premiums on the medical, dental and/or vision plans (with adjustment for any PhD student insurance support, if applicable). SHIP cancellations are effective from the first of the month following the month in which the cancellation form is received.\n\nThe final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31, for an April 1 cancellation.  May, June and July cancellations are not permitted.\n\nIf you are graduating in December and would like to cancel your insurance plan, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.\n\nCancellations are only available under the following circumstances:\n\nDecember Graduation (or September certification for doctoral students graduating in December)\n\nFormal separation from CMU (i.e. leave of absence, withdrawal, suspension, forfeit)\n\nFall semester foreign exchange students returning to their university after the fall semester\n\nEnrollment in Medicaid in the state in which you are studying (e.g., a Pittsburgh campus student approved for enrollment into PA Medicaid). Enrollment is based on eligibility and the application process can be lengthy. Students must also have applied for Medicaid before or during their open enrollment period. Locate PA state information.\n\nThe option to join a new plan does not make a student eligible to cancel their current insurance enrollment.\n\nIf you meet this criterion, email UHS when your university enrollment status has been updated to reflect one of the statuses listed above (or when you wish to remove a dependent or have been approved for Medicaid) and we can assist you. You may be eligible to receive a pro-rated refund for the remaining months' premiums.\n\nThe final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31 and the insurance plan cannot be canceled after April 1 (May, June and July cancellations are not permitted).\n\nYou can only enroll in the SHIP outside of your Open Enrollment period if you have had a qualifying life event (for example, involuntary loss of insurance, including due to turning age 26). This applies to the student medical, dental and vision plans; you cannot add the dental or vision plan outside of Open Enrollment without a qualifying event.\n\nIf you are already enrolled in a SHIP plan, you can add dependents who have had a qualifying life event (for example, birth/adoption of a child or arrival to the U.S. for the first time during the coverage year).\n\nYou have 90 days from the qualifying life event into enroll in the SHIP medical, dental or vision plan. You will also need to provide supporting documentation .\n\nRemoving Dependents:\n\nDependents can be removed from your insurance plan at any time before March 31 of the coverage year.\n\nTo make any of these changes, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.\n\nThe CMU SHIP is a national plan, with participating in-network providers in every state. To search for medical care, dental care, vision care and pharmacies in your desired location:\n\nFor routine care, University Health Services (UHS) does not recommend specific providers, but if you are in need of non-urgent care:\n\nBefore scheduling any appointment, verify directly with each provider or facility that they participate in the CMU SHIP network.\n\nBoth inpatient and outpatient mental health services are covered 100% if the provider is in-network with the SHIP. If you are enrolled in the SHIP, there are a few options for locating services in your area:\n\nCMU SHIP (medical plan) members have access to the same health coverage benefits while abroad as they do while in the U.S. through BCBS Global Core, along with 24 hour emergency medical and travel assistance through the AXA Travel Assistance Program.\n\nYes. Students graduating in August are eligible to enroll in the medical SHIP for the month of August only. August-only enrollments are only available for the student medical plan; dental and vision plans are not available.\n\nIf you are in need of an August-only enrollment, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.\n\nStudents graduating in May are not eligible to extend their SHIP.  Your SHIP enrollment will terminate on August 1.\n\nStudents graduating in August are eligible to enroll in the SHIP for the month of August only. If you are in need of an August-only enrollment, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.\n\nCMU is not using Social Security Numbers for student insurance enrollment, but Highmark is required by law to send letters on an annual basis to members requesting their Social Security/Tax Identification Number. Members who do not provide this information will not be penalized, nor are they required to provide the information. Students may disregard the letter.\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• HUB International: 888-777-9980  or CMUSHIP@hubinternational.com\n• CMU Student Health Insurance: 412-268-2157 option 3 or shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n• SHIP Plan Documents\n• Call the Highmark number on the back of your insurance card or email UHS.\n\n• email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu.\n\n• Email HUB International with your updated details.\n\n• For questions about a UHS charge email the student health insurance team.\n\n• If the bill indicates little/no insurance was applied to the claim (often noted as an \"Uninsured Discount\"), please contact the medical provider directly, give them your insurance information and ask that they re-submit the claim to the SHIP. \n\nIf you saw a provider at UPMC, you can register with UPMC to track claims and bills.\n• If you saw a provider at UPMC, you can register with UPMC to track claims and bills.\n• If you recieved a bill for medical services, refer to the Medical Plan Coverage Table to verify coverage and copay amounts. \n\nIf you received a bill for dental or vision services, refer to the dental and vision plan books for coverage and copay amounts.\n• If you received a bill for dental or vision services, refer to the dental and vision plan books for coverage and copay amounts.\n• If you still have questions about SHIP coverage, please call the Member Services phone number on the back of your insurance ID card.  Member Services will be able to look at your claims, and verify coverage based on the diagnosis and procedure codes provided with the claim.\n\n• If you saw a provider at UPMC, you can register with UPMC to track claims and bills.\n\n• If you received a bill for dental or vision services, refer to the dental and vision plan books for coverage and copay amounts.\n\n• Basic diagnostic testing is covered by the SHIP at in-network labs, but students will owe a $25 copay for the date of service.\n• If a test is not fully covered by the SHIP, students will recieve a bill from the laboratory for that amount.\n• Bills are sent to the address listed on your SHIP enrollment.\n• Students can find information on lab claims by accessing their Explanations of Benefits (EOB) in their Highmark portal.

What if I want to add or remove someone from my plan?\n\n[H2] How do I find in-network health care providers? What if I need to see a doctor or fill a prescription while I am away from campus?\n\n[H2] I am graduating in August. Can I enroll in the SHIP for only the month of August?\n\n[H2] Can I extend the SHIP after graduating in May?\n\n[H2] Why did Highmark send me a letter asking for my Social Security or Tax ID number?\n\n[H3] Mental Health Providers:\n\n[H3] Medical Coverage While Abroad:\n\nSHIP enrollment or waiver status:\n\nQuestions about SHIP coverage (medical procedures, medication, etc.):\n\nQuestions about insurance fees on your student account:\n\nTo update your name, gender, birthdate or mailing address with Highmark:\n\nDepending on the treatment you received, you may have a copay and/or an amount not covered by the insurance plan. The bill from the medical provider will show the charges for the treatment, what your insurance plan has paid and what you owe.\n\nTo start, it is helpful to review the SHIP's Medical Plan Coverage Table, as well as some common insurance terms, in order to better understand what services are covered under the plan.  It is also important to register with Highmark where you can track your medical claims and access your Explanations of Benefits (EOB). The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.\n\nUniversity Health Services (UHS) Charges:\n\nIf you are enrolled in the SHIP and receive care at University Health Services (UHS), many of the fees for our services will be covered by the plan.  If you do owe any fees, those charges will be posted to your student account.\n\nBills from off-campus providers:\n\nIf you see a provider or have a hospital visit outside of UHS, you may receive a bill for non-covered services, and/or copays:\n\nLaboratory Testing:\n\nBills for Ambulance Transport:\n\nThe SHIP covers the cost of emergency ambulance transports, however students are responsible for paying the transport company directly. Highmark will mail you a check for the amount of the transport, once it arrives you have two options:\n\nIf you receive a medical bill and still need assistance, please message the Student Health Insurance Team through HealthConnect, and include a copy of your bill and Explanation of Benefits, if available.\n\nWisdom teeth (third molar) removal is covered under the SHIP Dental Plan and Medical Plan. However, coverage will depend on whether your teeth are soft tissue impacted, or bony impacted.\n\nDental Plan Coverage:\n\nThe SHIP Dental Plan provides benefits for both bony impacted, and soft tissue impacted, wisdom teeth:\n\nYou can review the coverage for third molar removal on the summary of benefits and coverage, located on page 27 of the dental plan book.\n\nMedical Plan Coverage:\n\nThe SHIP Medical Plan only provides benefits for impacted wisdom teeth when partially or totally covered by bone:\n\nYou can review the coverage for third molar removal on page 26 of the medical plan book.\n\nEvaluations & Procedures\n\nBefore having your wisdom teeth removed, you will need to be evaluated. If you have both the SHIP dental plan and medical plan you can get an evaluation from a dentist, or oral surgeon.\n\nThe CMU Medical SHIP provides dental and vision services for students, and their eligible dependents, under the age of 19. This coverage is seperate from the optional dental and vision plans.\n\nPediatric Dental Benefits\n\nPediatric Vision Benefits\n\nClaim forms can be found in the Highmark forms library. Once you have selected the proper form, click the Tips icon for instructions on how to file the claim.\n\nYou can track your claims on your Highmark portal, or call Highmark Member Services with any claim related questions: 800-241-5704.\n\nIf you have the SHIP, prescription drugs are covered, with a copay, at in-network pharmacies. However, prescription drug costs vary according to the drug type (generic, brand-name and specialty), and their corresponding tier levels (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.). Lower tiers (generic) usually have lower copays, while higher tiers (brand-name and specialty) have higher copays.\n\nEnrollments and waivers do not carry over from one academic year to the next; completing Open Enrollment is an annual requirement. Students must enroll in, or waive, the CMU SHIP every academic year that they are enrolled at the university.\n\nAt the start of each academic year, all full-time students (and some part-time students) enrolled in a degree-seeking program are assessed a placeholder charge for the CMU Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). This placeholder charge remains on a student's account until they complete Open Enrollment.\n\nIf you do not complete Open Enrollment, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU Medical SHIP and the insurance fee will remain on your student account.\n\nIf you receive an approved waiver, the insurance fee will be credited back to your student account.\n\nPlease note that invoices are generated on the first day of each month. Please check the Account Activity page in SIO for up-to-date charges and credits.\n\nStudent account or invoice questions should be directed to Student Financial Services.\n\nNo, the insurance fee posted on a student's account is a placeholder charge, and paying the insurance fee does not complete your SHIP enrollment.\n\nStudents must submit a SHIP enrollment during their Open Enrollment period:\n\nInsurance ID cards should arrive 2-3 weeks after your enrollment has been processed. If you are need of your member ID number before your card arrives:\n\nA U.S. mailing address is required to enroll in the CMU SHIP. Enrollments submitted with a non-U.S. address, or an incomplete address, will not be processed.\n\nInternational students enrolling in the CMU SHIP should wait until they have secured a U.S. mailing address where they can receive mail before submitting an enrollment. Waiting until later in the Open Enrollment period to enroll in the SHIP will not affect the coverage dates. SHIP coverage begins on August 1 each academic year, even if you do not submit your enrollment until the end of the Open Enrollment period.\n\nThe CMU SHIP is a full year plan with a coverage period of August 1 - July 31 each academic year. Students entering CMU in the Fall are enrolled and charged for the full coverage year.\n\nStudents graduating in December can request to cancel the SHIP at that time; it does not cancel automatically. Students with an approved cancellation will receive a prorated refund of the remaining months' premiums on the medical, dental and/or vision plans (with adjustment for any PhD student insurance support, if applicable).

The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.\n\nIf you have received a bill, or would like more detailed information on medical billing (including ambulance charges), please visit the Common Questions page.\n\nClaim forms can be found in the Highmark forms library. Select the Tips icon for instructions on how to file each claim. Once filed, you can track your claims on your Highmark portal.\n\nFor more details, please visit the Common Questions page.\n\nIf you have the SHIP, prescription drugs are covered, with a copay, at in-network pharmacies. However, prescription drug costs vary according to the drug type (generic, brand-name and specialty), and their corresponding tier levels (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.). Lower tiers (generic) usually have lower copays, while higher tiers (brand-name and specialty) have higher copays.\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• During Open Enrollment, a placeholder charge for the CMU SHIP is posted on your student account.\n• The placeholder charge will appear in your student account as Health Insurance - Student Only. However, during Open Enrollment, this does not indicate a SHIP enrollment.\n• Once you complete Open Enrollment, the charge will be credited back to your account if you receive an approved waiver or will remain in your account if you enroll in the SHIP.\n• Students who do not complete Open Enrollment will be auto-enrolled and charged for an individual medical SHIP enrollment. Auto-enrollments also incur a $50 processing fee.\n• Questions about charges on your student account, invoices or payments should be directed to Student Financial Services.\n\n• If you are enrolled in the SHIP and receive care at University Health Services (UHS), many of the fees for our services will be covered by the plan.  If you do owe a visit fee, that charge will be posted to your student account.\n• If you are enrolled in the SHIP and you see a provider or have a hospital visit outside of UHS, you may receive a bill for non-covered services, and/or copays.\n• If you have outside insurance and receive care at UHS, you will need to submit an itemized statement (available in HealthConnect) to your insurance company for reimbursement. Please call the member services phone number on the back of your insurance card for further instructions on how to submit your claim.\n\n• Basic diagnostic testing is covered by the SHIP at in-network labs, but students will owe a $25 copay for the date of service.\n• If a test is not fully covered by the SHIP, students will recieve a bill from the laboratory for that amount.\n• Bills are sent to the address listed on your SHIP enrollment.\n• Students can find information on lab claims by accessing the Explanations of Benefits (EOB) in their Highmark portal. The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.\n• Bloodwork done at UHS is sent to Quest Diagnostics for processing:\n\nto track claims, pay a bill, or for any questions regarding bills register with Quest Diagnostics and/or call Quest Member Services.\n• to track claims, pay a bill, or for any questions regarding bills register with Quest Diagnostics and/or call Quest Member Services.\n\n• to track claims, pay a bill, or for any questions regarding bills register with Quest Diagnostics and/or call Quest Member Services.\n\n• Review how to search for covered medications and corresponding copays.\n• If prescribed a higher tiered medication, speak to your provider, or pharmacist, about the possiblity of receiveing the less costly generic version, if available.\n• Some medications can be filled at UHS when you see a UHS provider. \n\nMedications at UHS will incur up to a $15 copay per medication.\n• Medications at UHS will incur up to a $15 copay per medication.\n• Over-the-counter medicine and supplies (not prescribed) are not covered by the SHIP when purchased at a retail store (example: CVS or Rite Aid).\n\n• Medications at UHS will incur up to a $15 copay per medication.\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsibility\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\n• Disability Resources\n• Title IX Initiatives\n• University Police\n• University Policies\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• © 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Facebook\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• HealthConnect\n• New Students\n• Family & Parents\n• Student Insurance\n    \n\n                      Enroll in the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Waive the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Change or Cancel the SHIP \n    \n\n                      SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n    \n\n                      SHIP Rates & Billing\n    \n\n                      Using the SHIP\n    \n\n                      International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n    \n\n                      Insurance Literacy\n    \n\n                      Contacts & Common Questions\n    \n\n                      Leaving CMU\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n• Services & Fees\n    \n\n                      COVID19 \n    \n\n                      Sexual Assault Resources\n    \n\n                      LGBTQIA+ Health\n    \n\n                      Sexual Health\n    \n\n                      Allergy Injections\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n• Health Education & Resources\n    \n\n                      Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n    \n\n                      Local Healthcare Resources\n    \n\n                      Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n    \n\n\n\n                      Recovery and Harm Reduction\n    \n\n                      Wellness To Go Machines\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n• About Us\n    \n\n                      UHS News\n    \n\n                      Who We Are\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n\n• Information for PHAs\n\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n\n\n[TABLE]\n2025-2026 Annual Premium Rates \nCoverage August 1, 2025 -

These experiences and lessons are an important part of the process of maturation. As students change and grow they will likely encounter struggles. While this is a natural part of the process of becoming an adult, students might feel confused, anxious, overwhelmed, or distressed at times. Students benefit greatly by feeling supported and understood throughout the good times and the times of struggle.\n\nHere are a few suggestions on how to support your student while at CMU:\n\nIf your student contacts you in a state of distress or appears different than usual, we encourage you to remain calm and supportive while asking directly about what might be wrong. If your student is willing to talk, you can help them think through the issue and find possible options. If your student is hesitant to talk, encourage them to consider contacting CaPS, their RA, or speaking to a trusted friend/relative as a starting point. We encourage you to learn about resources available to your student in order to help them take the important step of reaching out for help.\n\nPlease check out the Student Support and Resources page to find out more about resources available to undergraduate and graduate students at Carnegie Mellon.\n\nPsychological crises are subjective. They can range from mild to life-threatening and can be obvious or subtle. If you feel your student is experiencing a psychological crisis, we recommend you take your concerns seriously and respond in a caring and immediate way. Consider encouraging your student to call CaPS. Phone counselors are available after hours.\n\nIf you are concerned that they can’t care for themselves, or are at risk of hurting themselves in the moment, these are the numbers to call:\n\nPlease be aware that we are bound by law to protect confidentiality of anyone receiving our services. We do not share any personal information unless a student has signed a consent form or information is needed to protect safety. If you would like to talk to someone at CaPS regarding your student’s well-being, ask your student to sign a Release of Information form (ROI).\n\nIf a student does not sign an ROI, you may still call CaPS to share your concerns. We welcome information that might help a student when there are urgent psychological or emotional concerns. The therapist can listen to your concerns and consult about general issues that do not pertain to your student directly. Note, however, that the therapist will not be able to acknowledge that your student is engaged in services at CaPS nor provide you with any personal information.\n\nWe encourage you to follow up with the student after you have made a referral. Ideally, the student will talk with you directly to let you know how they are doing after the referral.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• If student resides on campus, call CMU Police at 412-268-2323.\n• If student resides off campus, call Pittsburgh Police at 911 (if calling from Pittsburgh area) or 412-255-2927 (if calling from out of town).\n\n• Stay connected. Listen to your student. Often students simply need to talk about what's going on in their lives and want a familiar, trusted person to listen.\n• Ask questions. Show that you're interested in what your student is doing, how they are adjusting, and what they are learning. Your student may not want to talk in depth each time, but they will know you are there for them when they need someone to talk to.\n• Allow your student to set the agenda for some of your conversations. If he or she needs help or support, make room for touchy subjects to arise and be handled calmly.\n• Expect change. The later stages of adolescent development might include changes in the nature of your relationship with your student. As your student develops independence and autonomy, some changes can feel unsettling and scary. The best option is to accept that changes will and should happen, but talk with your student about the changes and work together to identify the best way to adjust.\n• Remember that autonomy and responsibility are the goals. The college years are the time that individuals develop into young adults. This process benefits from a flexible and responsive parenting style that accommodates shifts of control and independence. We encourage you to talk with your student and consider negotiating new expectations along the way.\n\n• If student resides on campus, call CMU Police at 412-268-2323.\n• If student resides off campus, call Pittsburgh Police at 911 (if calling from Pittsburgh area) or 412-255-2927 (if calling from out of town).\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsiblity\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Professional Training\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• Â© 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• Get Support\n    \n\n                      Support For Yourself\n    \n\n                      For Someone Else\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n• Services\n    \n\n                      Gender Affirming Care\n    \n\n                      Let's Talk\n    \n\n                      Consultation\n    \n\n                      Groups & Skills Clinics\n    \n\n                      Individual Therapy\n    \n\n                      Outreach Prevention & Education\n    \n\n                      Psychiatric Care\n    \n\n                      Referrals\n    \n\n                      Tele-Mental Health\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n• TimelyCare\n• Resources\n• Professional Training\n• Get Involved\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n    \n\n                      Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Contact CaPS\n• About CaPS\n    \n\n                      Frequently Asked Questions\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• CaPS Event D-List Sign Up\n\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2142\nPhone: 412-268-2922\nPhone: 412-255-2927\nPhone: 412-268-2075\nPhone: 412-268-2323",

The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.\n\nIf you have received a bill, or would like more detailed information on medical billing (including ambulance charges), please visit the Common Questions page.\n\nClaim forms can be found in the Highmark forms library. Select the Tips icon for instructions on how to file each claim. Once filed, you can track your claims on your Highmark portal.\n\nFor more details, please visit the Common Questions page.\n\nIf you have the SHIP, prescription drugs are covered, with a copay, at in-network pharmacies. However, prescription drug costs vary according to the drug type (generic, brand-name and specialty), and their corresponding tier levels (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.). Lower tiers (generic) usually have lower copays, while higher tiers (brand-name and specialty) have higher copays.\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• During Open Enrollment, a placeholder charge for the CMU SHIP is posted on your student account.\n• The placeholder charge will appear in your student account as Health Insurance - Student Only. However, during Open Enrollment, this does not indicate a SHIP enrollment.\n• Once you complete Open Enrollment, the charge will be credited back to your account if you receive an approved waiver or will remain in your account if you enroll in the SHIP.\n• Students who do not complete Open Enrollment will be auto-enrolled and charged for an individual medical SHIP enrollment. Auto-enrollments also incur a $50 processing fee.\n• Questions about charges on your student account, invoices or payments should be directed to Student Financial Services.\n\n• If you are enrolled in the SHIP and receive care at University Health Services (UHS), many of the fees for our services will be covered by the plan.  If you do owe a visit fee, that charge will be posted to your student account.\n• If you are enrolled in the SHIP and you see a provider or have a hospital visit outside of UHS, you may receive a bill for non-covered services, and/or copays.\n• If you have outside insurance and receive care at UHS, you will need to submit an itemized statement (available in HealthConnect) to your insurance company for reimbursement. Please call the member services phone number on the back of your insurance card for further instructions on how to submit your claim.\n\n• Basic diagnostic testing is covered by the SHIP at in-network labs, but students will owe a $25 copay for the date of service.\n• If a test is not fully covered by the SHIP, students will recieve a bill from the laboratory for that amount.\n• Bills are sent to the address listed on your SHIP enrollment.\n• Students can find information on lab claims by accessing the Explanations of Benefits (EOB) in their Highmark portal. The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.\n• Bloodwork done at UHS is sent to Quest Diagnostics for processing:\n\nto track claims, pay a bill, or for any questions regarding bills register with Quest Diagnostics and/or call Quest Member Services.\n• to track claims, pay a bill, or for any questions regarding bills register with Quest Diagnostics and/or call Quest Member Services.\n\n• to track claims, pay a bill, or for any questions regarding bills register with Quest Diagnostics and/or call Quest Member Services.\n\n• Review how to search for covered medications and corresponding copays.\n• If prescribed a higher tiered medication, speak to your provider, or pharmacist, about the possiblity of receiveing the less costly generic version, if available.\n• Some medications can be filled at UHS when you see a UHS provider. \n\nMedications at UHS will incur up to a $15 copay per medication.\n• Medications at UHS will incur up to a $15 copay per medication.\n• Over-the-counter medicine and supplies (not prescribed) are not covered by the SHIP when purchased at a retail store (example: CVS or Rite Aid).\n\n• Medications at UHS will incur up to a $15 copay per medication.\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsibility\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\n• Disability Resources\n• Title IX Initiatives\n• University Police\n• University Policies\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• © 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Facebook\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• HealthConnect\n• New Students\n• Family & Parents\n• Student Insurance\n    \n\n                      Enroll in the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Waive the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Change or Cancel the SHIP \n    \n\n                      SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n    \n\n                      SHIP Rates & Billing\n    \n\n                      Using the SHIP\n    \n\n                      International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n    \n\n                      Insurance Literacy\n    \n\n                      Contacts & Common Questions\n    \n\n                      Leaving CMU\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n• Services & Fees\n    \n\n                      COVID19 \n    \n\n                      Sexual Assault Resources\n    \n\n                      LGBTQIA+ Health\n    \n\n                      Sexual Health\n    \n\n                      Allergy Injections\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n• Health Education & Resources\n    \n\n                      Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n    \n\n                      Local Healthcare Resources\n    \n\n                      Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n    \n\n\n\n                      Recovery and Harm Reduction\n    \n\n                      Wellness To Go Machines\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n• About Us\n    \n\n                      UHS News\n    \n\n                      Who We Are\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n\n• Information for PHAs\n\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n\n\n[TABLE]\n2025-2026 Annual Premium Rates \nCoverage August 1, 2025 -

CaPS strives to promote and support inclusion and justice within CaPS and the CMU community. Our goal is to construct mechanisms that foster and empower individual, collective and systemic accountability within CaPS, in the context of equity and social justice.\n\nRead our statement below.\n\nOur commitment to providing support extends beyond clinical practice and into our interactions with colleagues, campus partners, and the broader community. We are aware of the challenges many students face in their daily lives and the emotional toll they may carry. We are here to support you in navigating these challenges, offering comfort and assistance as needed. To our students especially, CaPS is here to support you.CaPS understands that statements of support are only a part of the process. We are dedicated to being active participants in meaningful progress, not simply offering words of solidarity. We are committed to providing care to all students who are impacted by adversity and hardship. We are also committed to facilitating conversations within our Tartan community that promote awareness and create an environment where every individual feels safe and supported\n\nInclusion & Mental Health Goal: CaPS aims at creating an environment where all students feel valued and understood.\n\nWhile the resources provided below are identity-based, we recognize that the intersectionality of identity is nuanced and multidimensional, and that you will find yourself represented in more than one category.\n\nIdeally, therapy is a place where one can feel safe and understood. Working with a culturally responsive counselor can be truly beneficial and healing.\n\nMany therapists have received some form of cultural competency education in their training and educational journeys but it is often limited in scope and practice. A culturally sensitive therapist pays attention to the client’s and their own identities, social and cultural backgrounds, and past and current socio-political events to guide the treatment and relationship.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list of questions that a culturally sensitive therapist should be able to address with their clients, it is a good place to start.\n\nIntersectionality, as coined by scholar and writer Kimberlé Crenshaw, is a lens through which we seek to understand how multiple forms of oppression/inequality may combine to create unique obstacles and trauma.\n\nMany therapists have received some form of cultural competency education in their training and educational journeys but it is often limited in scope and practice. A culturally sensitive therapist pays attention to the client’s and their own identities, social and cultural backgrounds, and past and current socio-political events to guide the treatment and relationship.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• Research professional organizations and memberships that can provide referrals to qualified culturally responsive therapists in your area. The Psychology Today website allows you to select specific filters to identify a therapist that fits your needs.\n• Check out therapists' websites and/or social media. Consider how they talk about their approach to therapy and whether they speak to issues of social justice and inclusivity within their work.\n• Most importantly, ask questions. While this might feel uncomfortable given the professional nature of the relationship, you must feel comfortable with your therapist. If the therapist is unwilling or unable to answer your questions, we suggested that you consider discontinuing meeting with this individual.\n\n• How would you describe your experience treating clients who share my [insert your racial/cultural identity here i.e.“Indigenous”] identity?\n• What is your/your practice’s experience incorporating a racial equity/anti-racist lens into your treatment?\n• How would you describe your knowledge of safety risks and considerations related to my [insert your racial/cultural identity here i.e. “Black”] identity?\n• What training/evidence-based treatment do you/your practice have for issues that may arise related to [insert your racial/cultural identity, i.e. “Asian”] health and wellness?\n• Can you share with me your/your practice’s training/evidence-based treatment for issues that may arise from trauma related to [insert “anti” and your racial/cultural identity, i.e. “anti-Black”] oppression, racism and/or racial violence?\n• What kind of resources/training do you/your practice have available to remain up-to-date with [insert your racial/cultural identity, i.e. “Asian”] issues both locally and nationally so that I can avoid having to educate my provider?\n• What is your/your practice’s position on the mental health impact of navigating oppression, racism and racial violence?\n• What is your/your practice’s position on the impact of generational trauma as it relates to racism/racial violence?\n• How would you describe your knowledge of stereotypes and/or common misconceptions of my [insert your racial/cultural identity, i.e. “Latinx”] identity — things that you might say in a session that could result in trauma/microaggression?\n\n• How do you define intersectionality and how do you plan to utilize an intersectional lens in my treatment?\n• How can you help me navigate trauma related to the oppression I have and continue to face related to my [insert your QTBIPOC identity, i.e. “Black trans woman”] identity—understanding there are multiple systems of oppression impacting my mental health concurrently?\n• What is your/your practice’s position on the mental health impact of navigating multiple systems of oppression?\n• What is your racial/ethnic and cultural background?

This video shares a wealth of information about the ways UHS supports trans students:\n\nWe encourage LGBTQIA+ students to receive routine care. Specifically, UHS recommends that students follow guidelines for routine screening of sex-specific organs, like pap smears/gynecological exams, breast exams, prostate exams, etc. If you are uncomfortable with these types of exams, we are happy to talk with you about how to make them easier.\n\nUHS now offers Gender Affirming Care Navigation Appointments! Meet with a Health Promotion Specialist to receive gender identity-related support, such as: name change (legal and within CMU), mental health provider referrals, medical provider referrals, sexual health, HRT support, finding surgery providers, obtaining letters for surgeries, basic health insurance info/support, a listening ear, and more. Schedule your appointment through HealthConnect or by calling 412-268-2127 (select option 2).\n\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis is a new HIV prevention treatment. Taking PrEP once daily significantly lowers the risk of HIV transmission. PrEP is covered by the SHIP, CMU's student health insurance plan. Those with outside insurance should check to find out if PrEP is covered and what costs might apply. Additionally, the federal government announced in July of 2021 that almost all health insurers must cover the HIV prevention pill, known as PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, with no cost sharing — including for the drug itself and, crucially, for clinic visits and lab tests.\n\nStudents can make appointments to start or continue PrEP by calling 412-268-2157 (select option 2). Learn more about PrEP.\n\nUHS provides hormone therapy  for transgender students using the informed consent model. Hormone therapy is covered by the SHIP, CMU's student health insurance plan. Students can make appointments to start or continue Hormone therapy by calling 412-268-2157 (select option 2).\n\nInformed consent is an evidence-based model of providing care that is used in healthcare agencies serving and run primarily by LGBTQIA+ and trans and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) communities. This means that UHS does not require a student to get a letter from a mental health provider in support of hormones as long as they can provide informed consent for care. A student can provide informed consent if they have correct information about hormone therapy; are able to understand the information about hormone therapy that has been provided, including risks and benefits as well as reversible and irreversible effects; and/or are able to use this information to make a decision.\n\nThe informed consent model is consistent with WPATH Standards of Care and reduces barriers to accessing medically necessary treatment. In this model, students are given accurate and comprehensive information about hormone therapy and will be supported in making the decision that is right for them. Please note that providing care in an informed consent model does not mean that hormones are available on demand. If a medical provider determines that a student has a medical or psychological condition that might preclude the initiation of hormones until further evaluation or treatment, the student be will referred to the appropriate medical and/or psychological resources for further evaluation.\n\nThere are many substance use resources in the Pittsburgh community.This Young People and LGBTQIA+ Friendly 12-Step Meetings list includes information about local peer-to-peer meetings and treatment centers that center LGBTQIA+ folks. For more information about recovery and harm reduction at CMU, please visit the CMU Collegiate Recovery & Harm Reduction webpage.\n\nUHS can include chosen name*, gender identity and sex assigned at birth in medical records.

Now what?\n\nCaPS offers mental health services to all undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at the Pittsburgh campus*. We see approximately 13% of the student population each year.  Students come to CaPS for a variety of reasons, in some cases students use therapy for self-exploration as a way to better understanding themselves.   Other times, students are looking for emotional or psychological support on how to deal with a psychological difficulty. *For CMU Students NOT enrolled at the Pittsburgh campus, see the next FAQ.\n\nHere are some examples of reasons students come to CaPS:\n\n•    Self exploration  •    Depression, feeling too sad too much of the time •    Stress and anxiety •    Friendship issues, loneliness, isolation •    Adjusting to college, homesickness •    Problems with self-esteem, feeling bad about yourself •    Romantic relationship concerns •    Family of origin issues •    Roommate problems •    Sense of identity and personal growth •    Sexuality concerns •    Dealing with loss •    Academic issues, test anxiety, motivation, procrastination, career uncertainties •    Alcohol and drug use •    Concerns about problematic eating •    Sexual assault or abuse\n\nIt does not matter if what you are going through seems big or small to you; let’s talk about it!\n\nIf you feel concerned or worried about a friend click here.\n\nPsychotherapy is often called “counseling” or “therapy.” Psychotherapy is a process of addressing mental health and personal growth issues by talking them through in a private, confidential setting with a trained professional. The process involves weekly meetings to allow for the development of trust and comfort in the relationship between you and your therapist. This exploration in a supportive environment is a process that can lead to greater understanding and self-awareness. It can facilitate maturation and growth as well as help one develop the skills necessary to deal successfully with personal problems and life challenges.\n\nSessions at CaPS are 45-50 minutes in length. At first, the meetings are usually focused on information gathering. Your therapist will ask questions about the concerns which brought you in and about your life in general in order to get to know you and have a better understanding of your needs. One of the important goals of these meetings is to determine the right kind of treatment for you.\n\nSubsequent sessions may take different shapes or forms but, for the most part, your therapist will encourage you to talk freely about your thoughts, feelings, and whatever is troubling you. As sessions progress, you should feel more comfortable with your therapist and you may focus on many different subjects or themes. Don't worry if you find it hard to open up about your feelings. Your therapist can help you gain more comfort as time goes on. It is important you are open with your therapist and share with him/her your experience of your work together.  Both you and your therapist are in this together and communication and collaboration will be important for its success.\n\nWe all go through stressful situations and tough times in our lives. This is especially true during our college years, when we face new challenges and many changes. Reaching out to someone at CaPS will help you get the support you need to grow personally and thrive in college. Asking for help is a sign of strength and maturity; it is not a sign of weakness.\n\nWe encourage you to come to CaPS before your personal struggle becomes overwhelming. Some students wait until they are in a panic or reach a breaking point before seeking help, which can result in undue hardship and pain. You might want to consider seeking professional help when things in your personal life are not feeling quite right or when you are in distress and don’t know how to handle it. Many students engage in psychotherapy to learn more about themselves to be better equipped to manage life’s challenges.\n\nHere are a few examples of indications that you may be distressed and want to consider coming to CaPS:\n\nSleep – difficulties falling asleep, difficulties sleeping throughout the night, sleeping too much, not wanting to get out of bed, avoiding sleep by staying up all night. Getting a good night’s sleep on a regular basis is essential for mental health and for sustaining high levels of academic performance.\n\nAppetite – eating more, eating less, or choosing foods you don’t normally eat. Doing things like this with food is often a sign that something is going on psychologically and it is not being adequately addressed.\n\nSocial Withdrawal – withdrawing from family and friends (not wanting to talk to them or see them), staying by yourself too much, avoiding social situations, avoiding classes.\n\nFocus/Concentration – difficulty paying attention in class, difficulties focusing on assignments, having to re-read the same paragraph over and over again in order to understand what you are reading.\n\nMood – increased moodiness, sadness, irritability, anxiety, restlessness, worries, fear, or hopeless.\n\nEnergy Level – sustained decrease in energy level and motivation, or having too much energy (for example: unable to sleep or turn off your thoughts)\n\nMotivation – loss of interest in academic work, feeling uninterested in pleasurable activities, apathy.\n\nBehavior Changes – acting differently than usual (e.g. talking back at people, “not caring” attitude, not performing like you used to, not engaging in activities you used to enjoy, increased substance abuse, engaging in other self destructive behavior.\n\nIf you are still uncertain whether CaPS is the right place for you, you can call and ask to consult with a therapist. We will meet with you, talk about what is going on for you, and we will then discuss your options for treatment, if appropriate.\n\nTherapy is a process that involves regular meetings with a professional so that trust and intimacy can develop. Consultation is often a single encounter with a professional that is aimed at clarifying a discrete issue or problem and identifying some ways to cope or respond. Your first encounter with a therapist, whether for a routine or urgent visit will be a consultation. Additionally, therapists provide consultation to faculty, staff and concerned family members.\n\nWhen you begin the process of seeking professional help, it’s not easy to know where to start. We encourage students to use CaPS as the first step in figuring out what type of help is needed. Your first encounter with a CaPS therapist will help determine the right path, whether at CaPS or with a provider in the community.\n\nCaPS provides short-term psychotherapy. In cases when there is a desire or need for longer-term or specialized care, CaPS staff will help students connect with the right resources in the community. These might include long-term psychotherapy, psychiatric care, psychological testing and evaluations, or intensive specialized care for eating disorders or substance abuse.\n\nCaPS can help you find a therapist in the community but if you want to do this yourself here are a few tips and suggestions:\n\nThe APA Psychologist Locator and the Psychology Today website can also help you find a provider in your area.\n\nAll services at CaPS are free. If students are interested in continuing psychotherapy beyond our short-term model, or if they are in need of specialized or more intensive treatment, we can help them find services in the community that would fit their needs. These services in the community are usually paid for through the student’s health insurance.\n\nWe offer same day urgent appointments to support students in distress. Students can walk-in or call CaPS to be screened for a same day urgent consultation. At the time of the meeting, a therapist will evaluate your personal situation and formulate a plan with you on what is the best next step to take.\n\nCaPS clinical staff consists of nine full-time psychotherapists and four TCC clinicians. As an advanced training facility, CaPS has several therapists-in-training on staff as well. These are psychology doctoral students and psychiatric residents with prior experience in therapy and supervision. You can be confident that your therapist has the appropriate knowledge and experience to help you address your struggles. If you have any questions or feel you need to see a senior therapist, please call us (412-268-2922) and let us know of your concern. While the clinicians and therapists on staff at CaPS represent a variety of disciplines and styles, we all share a passion for working with college students and a vested interest in their well-being and personal growth.\n\nOne of the reasons group work is so beneficial is that it provides the opportunity to learn and grow through interaction with others in a supportive, safe, and confidential setting. Groups also help by connecting students with others who share similar concerns, allowing them to experience acceptance and belonging, give and receive support, and reduce isolation.\n\nGroup therapy helps group members experience new ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. A main focus in group therapy is your process of relating to other group members. This work can involve group members developing trust, building intimacy, or working through conflicts together. As group therapists facilitate a safe and confidential environment, group members are able to give support, offer feedback, help raise awareness of interpersonal patterns, and help address difficulties. Like other forms of therapy, what you get out of your group experience will depend largely on what you invest into it.\n\nIt may seem scary to think about discussing personal stuff with your peers. If you’re feeling hesitant—and many people do up front—that’s not necessarily a reason to not pursue group work. In fact, that may be a clue that group could be helpful to you, indicating that you could benefit from practicing your relationship skills and increasing your willingness and comfort in sharing your experiences (including your struggles) with others.\n\nHousing Accommodations are processed through the Office of Disability Resources (ODR).  Please visit ODR's website to download the application form and learn the procedure to request housing accommodation.  CaPS consults with ODR, as needed, to provide clarification or provide additional information about the diagnosed condition.\n\nPlease contact CaPS if you are wanting additional support around your diagnosed condition or if you need help finding treatment.\n\nIf you received academic accommodations at your previous educational institution (i.e., extended time for testing, quiet testing area, etc.) or your provider feels that you need them now, you could be eligible for such accommodations at CMU at an undergraduate or graduate school level.  CaPS partners with the Office of Disability Resources (ODR) to facilitate the process and help you with the proper documentation.  The Office of Disability Resources requires a licensed medical or mental health provider to provide current documentation that includes diagnosis, an explanation of how your disability impacts your academic performance or campus life, and recommended accommodations. This documentation can be provided directly to the Office of Disability Resources or a CaPS clinician can help you in the process.\n\nCaPS can help you get connected to the appropriate care and services in the Pittsburgh area and within CMU.  We recommend you schedule a consultation session for us to learn more about your needs and preferences with the purpose of making the appropriate recommendations, which may include services at CaPS, campus support services, or local community providers.  Our clinicians try to provide recommendations and referrals that are tailored to individual preferences and/or current circumstances (e.g. insurance coverage, gender, cultural or spiritual background, specific specialties or approaches of the provider).\n\nCaPS also offers phone consultations to those students who are not local and would like to have information and resources before arriving to the area.  During this phone consultation, you are welcome to have someone else (e.g. parent, guarding, sibling, etc.)  from home participate in the conversation.\n\nIf you are not wanting to schedule a consultation session, CaPS can help you obtain general referrals based on your insurance without a consultation. While it won’t be as tailored, we can still help you get started. If you have any challenges getting appointments or finding a good fit, you are always welcome to call back for more help.\n\nIf you would like to find your own therapist in the Pittsburgh area, please check our FAQ “What if I want to find my own therapist in the community?”   You can also follow the same guidelines to find a psychiatrist but, be aware, there are not many psychiatrist listed, so consulting with CaPS may be your best option for psychiatric referrals.\n\nFor routine new patient appointments, the amount of time to get in to see a provider can vary widely based on your availability and their openings. However, it generally takes several weeks (1-3 weeks on average) from appointment request to actual appointment with therapists. For psychiatrists, it can take longer (6-8 weeks on average) from appointment request to actual appointment. It is important to plan ahead for care to ensure no lapse in your medication. For new students moving to the area, we recommend calling several months in advance of moving to set up an appointment with a psychiatrist.\n\nSome of the same symptoms of ADHD such as distractibility, difficulty sustaining concentration, etc. are common symptoms of other conditions (depression, anxiety, trauma, significantly increased stress, adjustment to new demands/changes, significant sleep disruption, underlying medical conditions, side effects to medications, etc.). Therefore, it is important to obtain a thorough evaluation to determine whether the problems are specific to an ADHD diagnosis because treatment could be quite different based on the origin of the problem.\n\nThe first step is to schedule the evaluation, called a “neuropsychological evaluation.” The neuropsychological evaluation will help determine the diagnosis and the treatment options (i.e., therapy, medication, academic accommodations, etc.).  While these evaluations are not available at CaPS, we can help you find a community provider that accepts your insurance and could provide this.  Feel free to call CaPS to schedule a consultation and talk to us about your concerns and how to get started.\n\nPittsburgh has multiple private providers who specialize in neuropsychological evaluations and diagnose ADHD.  There is also a specialty clinic within walking distance of campus that provides evaluation and treatment of ADHD, ADHD Across the Lifespan Program at WPIC.\n\nFinding the right treatment for you will be important in learning how to manage your symptoms of ADHD.  The following supports are available:\n\n• Therapy: As students transition to college and/or graduate school, it can be quite overwhelming to establish new routines and establish new relationships in the face of increased demands and less structure. Individual and/or group therapy can help. CaPS can help you get connected to the appropriate therapy to support your needs. Please schedule a consultation at CaPS to discuss.\n\n• Medication: If you are interested in establishing psychiatric treatment with a provider in Pittsburgh, CaPS can assist with this process. Please keep in mind the following three details given that stimulant medications are controlled substances.\n\no Stimulants are highly regulated medications at the state and federal level. Your current physician will likely give you a 30-day supply before coming to school, but it takes some time to get in to see a psychiatrist (sometimes 6-8 weeks). Therefore, it is important to plan ahead and schedule an appointment with a Pittsburgh physician prior to finishing up with your current provider. If you are close to running out, our recommendation is for you to contact your most recent provider and ask for a new script to get you through until you see your next doctor.\n\no Extensive documentation of diagnostic evaluation and treatment records are usually required in order to continue prescriptions for stimulant medication. Therefore, you will need to sign a release of information for your records to be released. If you are interested in CaPS helping with this, schedule a consultation session at CaPS.  We will ask that you sign a release of information for your current provider to release your evaluation and medication records to CaPS. If the documentation of evaluation and diagnosis is missing or found to not be thorough enough, new doctors may refuse to prescribe until a new evaluation is completed.\n\no Click here if you would like to learn more information on how to connect with a psychiatrist at CMU.  CaPS partners with University Health Services (UHS) to provide transitional psychiatric care to students.\n\n• Executive Functioning/Academic Coaching: Some students have had this service in high school or are interested in connecting for the first time. This is a service that includes individual appointments with a coach who helps the student organize, plan and prioritize tasks for their week with classes and other demands. This coach also teaches strategies to increase independence at the college level, so that students can experience the most success. This service tends to be more intensive and individualized than what can be offered in Academic Development. Therefore, CaPS can help students connect with a specific community provider who can provide this service. It is important to note that this service is not covered by insurance and is private pay, but there are sometimes scholarships available.\n\n• CMU office of Academic Development: Transitioning to college and graduate school bring on new challenges in planning, organizing, studying, etc. The Academic Development office provides some level of academic coaching and workshops to give students strategies that are specific to the demands and changes in the college setting. They also provide individual tutoring and group sessions targeting traditionally difficult classes at CMU.\n\nIf you are diagnosed with ADHD you can also receive academic accommodations and housing accommodations.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• Find out what your insurance benefits are.  It would be helpful for you to know what your mental/behavioral health outpatient benefits are.  Find out if you have a deductible and if there is a co-payment (out of pocket cost) for the services.  Please note that for those students using the CMU Aetna health insurance, therapy sessions are covered in full with no co-payment.\n• Find out who your insurance covers. There are many times when you can access your insurance website for a list of providers in the area.  If this is not readily available online you can also call them and ask them to fax/tell you a list of providers in your area.\n• Narrow down your search. Once you have a list of therapists to choose from consider the following questions: do I have a gender preference? What area/location works better for me?  Some therapists list areas of specializations, if that is the case, think what areas would be helpful to you.\n• Identify two or three therapists. Because therapists may not always have openings or availabilities in the time frame that you want, we recommend you select two or three therapists from the list that meet your criteria. Be prepared to call and leave a clear message with your name and a phone number for them to reach you in order to schedule an appointment.\n• Meeting your therapist. We encourage you to approach the first encounter with openness and honesty, while also recognizing that you are trying to find a therapist who feels like a good fit for you.  Notice how you feel when you talk to the person, get a sense of what it feels like when you are with them, and attend to your level of comfort or discomfort with them.\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsiblity\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Professional Training\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• Â© 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• Get Support\n    \n\n                      Support For Yourself\n    \n\n                      For Someone Else\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n• Services\n    \n\n                      Gender Affirming Care\n    \n\n                      Let's Talk\n    \n\n                      Consultation\n    \n\n                      Groups & Skills Clinics\n    \n\n                      Individual Therapy\n    \n\n                      Outreach Prevention & Education\n    \n\n                      Psychiatric Care\n    \n\n                      Referrals\n    \n\n                      Tele-Mental Health\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n• TimelyCare\n• Resources\n• Professional Training\n• Get Involved\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n    \n\n                      Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Contact CaPS\n• About CaPS\n    \n\n                      Frequently Asked Questions\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• CaPS Event D-List Sign Up\n\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2922",

We offer consultation services for staff, faculty, advisors, or administrators. Consultation can address such issues as campus and community services, referring a student to services, and intervening with a student in distress.\n\nIf you see a student in trouble, you can help. We encourage faculty and staff members to respond to problematic student behavior unless the behavior is threatening or violent. While a few students might not welcome being approached, it is always best to attempt to talk with the student about your concerns and offer help. Approaching a distressed student in a caring and supportive way very often helps the student open up and share their thoughts with you. By engaging in this way, you can help them identify where and how to get help.\n\nThe following is a list of distress indicators you might observe in students:\n\nIf a student is falling behind in your class, consider the possibility that he/she may be struggling with one or more of these concerns. Most CMU students do not struggle academically because they lack the necessary intellect. They may be in some kind of distress, which is impacting their academic performance. While this does not excuse them from meeting academic expectations, your patience and helpful intervention could make a big difference in their emotional well-being and academic success. In some cases, your student might benefit from a referral for professional help.\n\nYour expression of concern may provide students the motivation they need to seek appropriate help or services. CaPS is available for consultation with faculty and staff if you are concerned about a student, unsure of an appropriate intervention, or need help in locating the appropriate resources.\n\nHere is a list of suggestions on how to respond to a student:\n\nStaff and faculty may contact the Office of Residential Education , Office of the Dean of Students , or Student Support Resources so that the appropriate person may get involved to assist both you and the student.\n\nFor most students, you can simply give them CaPS number or direct them to the 4th floor of the Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics.\n\nIf you are concerned about their motivation to follow through or you would like to share your concerns with the therapist, it may be helpful to call ahead to speak with the therapist and walk them over.\n\nIf you feel that a student is in crisis, you can call CaPS (412-268-2922) or encourage the student to call themselves. The CaPS receptionist will take some initial information and route the call appropriately. If you call, we will likely attempt to talk with the student directly, if possible, and we will schedule a meeting with the student within an appropriate time frame. If you feel comfortable, you can walk them to CaPS during business hours if they are willing. If so, please call ahead to let us know you are coming.\n\nIf you think a student is in imminent danger to self or others or is acting aggressively or violently call:\n\nIf student is on campus, call CMU Police at 412-268-2323.\n\nIf student is off campus, call Pittsburgh Police at 911 (if calling from Pittsburgh area) or 412-255-2927 (if calling from out of town).\n\nPlease be aware that we are bound by law to protect confidentiality of anyone receiving our services. We do not share any personal information unless a student has signed a consent form or information is needed to protect safety. If you would like to talk to someone at CaPS regarding your student’s well-being, ask your student to sign a Release of Information form (ROI).\n\nIf a student does not sign an ROI, you may still call CaPS to share your concerns. We welcome information that might help a student when there are urgent psychological or emotional concerns. The therapist can listen to your concerns and consult about general issues that do not pertain to your student directly. Note, however, that the therapist will not be able to acknowledge that your student is engaged in services at CaPS nor provide you with any personal information.\n\nWe encourage you to follow up with the student after you have made a referral. Ideally, the student will talk with you directly to let you know how they are doing after the referral.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• Disruptive Behavior – student exhibiting inappropriate behavior in a classroom or public spaces.\n• Observable Changes – distinct changes in academic performance, withdrawal from others, changes in class participation, crying, outbursts of anger, increased or decreased activity, and poor attendance are examples of significant behavioral changes.\n• Physical Complaints – students who repeatedly report physical illness or symptoms may be experiencing psychological problems. A change in eating patterns, sleep disturbances, fatigue, stomach aches, and pain are some common complaints that may be related to psychological problems.\n• Alcohol and Drug Abuse – coming to class or a meeting when intoxicated or high is a serious signal. It may become a problem that interferes with social, academic, and work functioning.\n• Academic Problems – students who have a noticeable decline in their academic performance may be feeling overwhelmed with other areas of their lives. Some students come to classes with difficulty concentrating, completing assignments, or performing well on exams.\n• Talking about Suicide – any instance in which a student talks or writes about suicide should be taken seriously. If you suspect a student might be thinking about suicide but aren’t sure, you should express your concern and ask them directly. Some examples of how to ask can be: \"Have you thought about killing yourself?\" or \"Have you been thinking about suicide?\" There is a myth that you will “plant” the idea of suicide in their head if you ask directly.  It can actually be quite helpful to talk with someone openly about your concerns and your desire to help.If you become aware of a student who is considering suicide, please make an immediate referral to CaPS.\n\n• Approach the student in a private setting, such as your office.\n• Include a description of the problem behavior you are observing and the specific consequences you see.\n• Remind the student that you are doing this out of genuine concern for him/her.\n• Remain calm and approach the student with a caring and supportive tone.\n• Listen carefully and encourage the student’s efforts to ask for help.\n• Help the student develop an action plan that addresses the problem.\n• Consider cultural differences that may be impacting the articulation of the issue, their expectations, and external pressures.\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsiblity\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Professional Training\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• Â© 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• Get Support\n    \n\n                      Support For Yourself\n    \n\n                      For Someone Else\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n• Services\n    \n\n                      Gender Affirming Care\n    \n\n                      Let's Talk\n    \n\n                      Consultation\n    \n\n                      Groups & Skills Clinics\n    \n\n                      Individual Therapy\n    \n\n                      Outreach Prevention & Education\n    \n\n                      Psychiatric Care\n    \n\n                      Referrals\n    \n\n                      Tele-Mental Health\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n• TimelyCare\n• Resources\n• Professional Training\n• Get Involved\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n    \n\n                      Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Contact CaPS\n• About CaPS\n    \n\n                      Frequently Asked Questions\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• CaPS Event D-List Sign Up\n\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2922\nPhone: 412-255-2927\nPhone: 412-268-2323",

Am I enrolled in the SHIP?\n\n[H2] Additional Common Questions\n\n[H2] I need my insurance ID card. Where can I find my insurance information?\n\n[H2] I do not have a U.S. mailing address yet. Can I enroll in the SHIP?\n\n[H2] If I am graduating in December, can I enroll in the SHIP for August - December only?  Can I enroll only for the months I am on campus?\n\n[H2] I no longer want my student insurance plan/s. Can I cancel the SHIP?\n\n[H2] Outside of Open Enrollment, can I enroll in the medical, dental or vision plans? What if I want to add or remove someone from my plan?\n\n[H2] How do I find in-network health care providers? What if I need to see a doctor or fill a prescription while I am away from campus?\n\n[H2] I am graduating in August. Can I enroll in the SHIP for only the month of August?\n\n[H2] Can I extend the SHIP after graduating in May?\n\n[H2] Why did Highmark send me a letter asking for my Social Security or Tax ID number?\n\n[H3] Mental Health Providers:\n\n[H3] Medical Coverage While Abroad:\n\nSHIP enrollment or waiver status:\n\nQuestions about SHIP coverage (medical procedures, medication, etc.):\n\nQuestions about insurance fees on your student account:\n\nTo update your name, gender, birthdate or mailing address with Highmark:\n\nDepending on the treatment you received, you may have a copay and/or an amount not covered by the insurance plan. The bill from the medical provider will show the charges for the treatment, what your insurance plan has paid and what you owe.\n\nTo start, it is helpful to review the SHIP's Medical Plan Coverage Table, as well as some common insurance terms, in order to better understand what services are covered under the plan.  It is also important to register with Highmark where you can track your medical claims and access your Explanations of Benefits (EOB). The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.\n\nUniversity Health Services (UHS) Charges:\n\nIf you are enrolled in the SHIP and receive care at University Health Services (UHS), many of the fees for our services will be covered by the plan.  If you do owe any fees, those charges will be posted to your student account.\n\nBills from off-campus providers:\n\nIf you see a provider or have a hospital visit outside of UHS, you may receive a bill for non-covered services, and/or copays:\n\nLaboratory Testing:\n\nBills for Ambulance Transport:\n\nThe SHIP covers the cost of emergency ambulance transports, however students are responsible for paying the transport company directly. Highmark will mail you a check for the amount of the transport, once it arrives you have two options:\n\nIf you receive a medical bill and still need assistance, please message the Student Health Insurance Team through HealthConnect, and include a copy of your bill and Explanation of Benefits, if available.\n\nWisdom teeth (third molar) removal is covered under the SHIP Dental Plan and Medical Plan. However, coverage will depend on whether your teeth are soft tissue impacted, or bony impacted.\n\nDental Plan Coverage:\n\nThe SHIP Dental Plan provides benefits for both bony impacted, and soft tissue impacted, wisdom teeth:\n\nYou can review the coverage for third molar removal on the summary of benefits and coverage, located on page 27 of the dental plan book.\n\nMedical Plan Coverage:\n\nThe SHIP Medical Plan only provides benefits for impacted wisdom teeth when partially or totally covered by bone:\n\nYou can review the coverage for third molar removal on page 26 of the medical plan book.\n\nEvaluations & Procedures\n\nBefore having your wisdom teeth removed, you will need to be evaluated. If you have both the SHIP dental plan and medical plan you can get an evaluation from a dentist, or oral surgeon.\n\nThe CMU Medical SHIP provides dental and vision services for students, and their eligible dependents, under the age of 19. This coverage is seperate from the optional dental and vision plans.\n\nPediatric Dental Benefits\n\nPediatric Vision Benefits\n\nClaim forms can be found in the Highmark forms library. Once you have selected the proper form, click the Tips icon for instructions on how to file the claim.\n\nYou can track your claims on your Highmark portal, or call Highmark Member Services with any claim related questions: 800-241-5704.\n\nIf you have the SHIP, prescription drugs are covered, with a copay, at in-network pharmacies. However, prescription drug costs vary according to the drug type (generic, brand-name and specialty), and their corresponding tier levels (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.). Lower tiers (generic) usually have lower copays, while higher tiers (brand-name and specialty) have higher copays.\n\nEnrollments and waivers do not carry over from one academic year to the next; completing Open Enrollment is an annual requirement. Students must enroll in, or waive, the CMU SHIP every academic year that they are enrolled at the university.\n\nAt the start of each academic year, all full-time students (and some part-time students) enrolled in a degree-seeking program are assessed a placeholder charge for the CMU Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). This placeholder charge remains on a student's account until they complete Open Enrollment.\n\nIf you do not complete Open Enrollment, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU Medical SHIP and the insurance fee will remain on your student account.\n\nIf you receive an approved waiver, the insurance fee will be credited back to your student account.\n\nPlease note that invoices are generated on the first day of each month. Please check the Account Activity page in SIO for up-to-date charges and credits.\n\nStudent account or invoice questions should be directed to Student Financial Services.\n\nNo, the insurance fee posted on a student's account is a placeholder charge, and paying the insurance fee does not complete your SHIP enrollment.\n\nStudents must submit a SHIP enrollment during their Open Enrollment period:\n\nInsurance ID cards should arrive 2-3 weeks after your enrollment has been processed. If you are need of your member ID number before your card arrives:\n\nA U.S. mailing address is required to enroll in the CMU SHIP. Enrollments submitted with a non-U.S. address, or an incomplete address, will not be processed.\n\nInternational students enrolling in the CMU SHIP should wait until they have secured a U.S. mailing address where they can receive mail before submitting an enrollment. Waiting until later in the Open Enrollment period to enroll in the SHIP will not affect the coverage dates. SHIP coverage begins on August 1 each academic year, even if you do not submit your enrollment until the end of the Open Enrollment period.\n\nThe CMU SHIP is a full year plan with a coverage period of August 1 - July 31 each academic year. Students entering CMU in the Fall are enrolled and charged for the full coverage year.\n\nStudents graduating in December can request to cancel the SHIP at that time; it does not cancel automatically. Students with an approved cancellation will receive a prorated refund of the remaining months' premiums on the medical, dental and/or vision plans (with adjustment for any PhD student insurance support, if applicable). SHIP cancellations are effective from the first of the month following the month in which the cancellation form is received.\n\nThe final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31, for an April 1 cancellation.  May, June and July cancellations are not permitted.\n\nIf you are graduating in December and would like to cancel your insurance plan, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.\n\nCancellations are only available under the following circumstances:\n\nDecember Graduation (or September certification for doctoral students graduating in December)\n\nFormal separation from CMU (i.e. leave of absence, withdrawal, suspension, forfeit)\n\nFall semester foreign exchange students returning to their university after the fall semester\n\nEnrollment in Medicaid in the state in which you are studying (e.g., a Pittsburgh campus student approved for enrollment into PA Medicaid). Enrollment is based on eligibility and the application process can be lengthy. Students must also have applied for Medicaid before or during their open enrollment period. Locate PA state information.\n\nThe option to join a new plan does not make a student eligible to cancel their current insurance enrollment.\n\nIf you meet this criterion, email UHS when your university enrollment status has been updated to reflect one of the statuses listed above (or when you wish to remove a dependent or have been approved for Medicaid) and we can assist you. You may be eligible to receive a pro-rated refund for the remaining months' premiums.\n\nThe final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31 and the insurance plan cannot be canceled after April 1 (May, June and July cancellations are not permitted).\n\nYou can only enroll in the SHIP outside of your Open Enrollment period if you have had a qualifying life event (for example, involuntary loss of insurance, including due to turning age 26). This applies to the student medical, dental and vision plans; you cannot add the dental or vision plan outside of Open Enrollment without a qualifying event.\n\nIf you are already enrolled in a SHIP plan, you can add dependents who have had a qualifying life event (for example, birth/adoption of a child or arrival to the U.S. for the first time during the coverage year).\n\nYou have 90 days from the qualifying life event into enroll in the SHIP medical, dental or vision plan. You will also need to provide supporting documentation .\n\nRemoving Dependents:\n\nDependents can be removed from your insurance plan at any time before March 31 of the coverage year.\n\nTo make any of these changes, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.\n\nThe CMU SHIP is a national plan, with participating in-network providers in every state. To search for medical care, dental care, vision care and pharmacies in your desired location:\n\nFor routine care, University Health Services (UHS) does not recommend specific providers, but if you are in need of non-urgent care:\n\nBefore scheduling any appointment, verify directly with each provider or facility that they participate in the CMU SHIP network.\n\nBoth inpatient and outpatient mental health services are covered 100% if the provider is in-network with the SHIP. If you are enrolled in the SHIP, there are a few options for locating services in your area:\n\nCMU SHIP (medical plan) members have access to the same health coverage benefits while abroad as they do while in the U.S. through BCBS Global Core, along with 24 hour emergency medical and travel assistance through the AXA Travel Assistance Program.\n\nYes. Students graduating in August are eligible to enroll in the medical SHIP for the month of August only. August-only enrollments are only available for the student medical plan; dental and vision plans are not available.\n\nIf you are in need of an August-only enrollment, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.\n\nStudents graduating in May are not eligible to extend their SHIP.  Your SHIP enrollment will terminate on August 1.\n\nStudents graduating in August are eligible to enroll in the SHIP for the month of August only. If you are in need of an August-only enrollment, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.\n\nCMU is not using Social Security Numbers for student insurance enrollment, but Highmark is required by law to send letters on an annual basis to members requesting their Social Security/Tax Identification Number. Members who do not provide this information will not be penalized, nor are they required to provide the information. Students may disregard the letter.\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• HUB International: 888-777-9980  or CMUSHIP@hubinternational.com\n• CMU Student Health Insurance: 412-268-2157 option 3 or shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n• SHIP Plan Documents\n• Call the Highmark number on the back of your insurance card or email UHS.\n\n• email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu.\n\n• Email HUB International with your updated details.\n\n• For questions about a UHS charge email the student health insurance team.\n\n• If the bill indicates little/no insurance was applied to the claim (often noted as an \"Uninsured Discount\"), please contact the medical provider directly, give them your insurance information and ask that they re-submit the claim to the SHIP. \n\nIf you saw a provider at UPMC, you can register with UPMC to track claims and bills.\n• If you saw a provider at UPMC, you can register with UPMC to track claims and bills.\n• If you recieved a bill for medical services, refer to the Medical Plan Coverage Table to verify coverage and copay amounts. \n\nIf you received a bill for dental or vision services, refer to the dental and vision plan books for coverage and copay amounts.\n• If you received a bill for dental or vision services, refer to the dental and vision plan books for coverage and copay amounts.\n• If you still have questions about SHIP coverage, please call the Member Services phone number on the back of your insurance ID card.  Member Services will be able to look at your claims, and verify coverage based on the diagnosis and procedure codes provided with the claim.\n\n• If you saw a provider at UPMC, you can register with UPMC to track claims and bills.\n\n• If you received a bill for dental or vision services, refer to the dental and vision plan books for coverage and copay amounts.\n\n• Basic diagnostic testing is covered by the SHIP at in-network labs, but students will owe a $25 copay for the date of service.\n• If a test is not fully covered by the SHIP, students will recieve a bill from the laboratory for that amount.\n• Bills are sent to the address listed on your SHIP enrollment.\n• Students can find information on lab claims by accessing their Explanations of Benefits (EOB) in their Highmark portal.

For the CMU SHIP, most copays are $0-$25. Some services have a higher copay, such as advanced imaging ($40), emergency room visits ($125), and hospital admissions ($150). You must pay the copay once for each visit where it is applicable. Prescriptions also incur a copay, but copays depend on the type of medication and frequency of refill.\n\nA deductible is the amount of money you pay for health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay covered expenses. It is important to review insurance plans so you are aware if there is a deductible or not. Once the deductible is met, the plan will start covering benefits as outlined in the policy.\n\nThe CMU medical SHIP has no deductible for in-network care, but there is a deductible for out-of-network care. The dental SHIP has a deductible for both in-network and out-of-network care.\n\nCoinsurance is a portion of healthcare charges that the member is responsible to pay, usually after a deductible has been met. There is no coinsurance for in-network care with the CMU medical SHIP. For out-of-network care with the CMU SHIP, you would be responsible for 20% of covered charges, after paying the deductible amount. Coinsurance rates vary depending on the plan and the service, so you must review plan(s) carefully.\n\nEOBs show the total charges for your visit and which portion of charges the health insurance plan will cover. EOBs are not bills. EOBs help you understand how much your health plan covers, and what you can expect to pay when you get a bill from your provider.\n\nTHE CMU SHIP is a Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO plan.\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• In-Network providers (doctors) or facilities (laboratories, urgent care centers, hospitals, or imaging centers) participate in your insurance plan network. The most cost effective way to seek care is to see healthcare providers that are in-network. If you have the CMU SHIP and see an in-network provider, there is no deductible.\n• Out-of-Network providers do not participate in your insurance plan network. If you have the CMU medical SHIP and see an out-of-network provider, the plan will cover 80% of the cost of the service after you meet your deductible. The dental plan has different coinsurance rates.\n\n• Students can access their EOBs in the claims section of their Highmark portal.\n\n• A PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) medical plan provides healthcare coverage through a network of providers, and you pay less if you use providers and hospitals within the plan's network. However, you can go outside of the network for an additional cost (see coinsurance).\n• An HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) plan provides healthcare coverage through a network of providers, but you are generally limited to seeing providers within the HMO network for covered services, with limited or no coverage for out-of-network care (except for emergencies). HMO networks are generally limited to the area where the person lived at the time of their enrollment.\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsibility\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\n• Disability Resources\n• Title IX Initiatives\n• University Police\n• University Policies\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• © 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Facebook\n• CMU on Twitter\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• HealthConnect\n• New Students\n• Family & Parents\n• Student Insurance\n    \n\n                      Enroll in the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Waive the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Change or Cancel the SHIP \n    \n\n                      SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n    \n\n                      SHIP Rates & Billing\n    \n\n                      Using the SHIP\n    \n\n                      International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n    \n\n                      Insurance Literacy\n    \n\n                      Contacts & Common Questions\n    \n\n                      Leaving CMU\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n• Services & Fees\n    \n\n                      COVID19 \n    \n\n                      Sexual Assault Resources\n    \n\n                      LGBTQIA+ Health\n    \n\n                      Sexual Health\n    \n\n                      Allergy Injections\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n• Health Education & Resources\n    \n\n                      Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n    \n\n                      Local Healthcare Resources\n    \n\n                      Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n    \n\n\n\n                      Recovery and Harm Reduction\n    \n\n                      Wellness To Go Machines\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n• About Us\n    \n\n                      UHS News\n    \n\n                      Who We Are\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n\n• Information for PHAs\n\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2157",

      "content": "Thank you for your interest in receiving allergy injections at our office while attending Carnegie Mellon University.\nYour ability to receive your injections at our health center requires you to obtain information from your prescribing allergist.\nThe information we need is included with this letter and is titled, “Information from the Prescribing Allergist”. We\nencourage you to contact your allergist as soon as possible to request they provide the necessary information to us. WE\nDO NOT ACCEPT PATIENTS WHO NEED MORE THAN THREE INJECTIONS OR THE FREQUENCY IS MORE THAN\nWEEKLY.\nWe ask you to abide by certain guidelines for receiving allergy injections in our office. These guidelines include the\nfollowing:\nInformation from your Allergist. You are responsible for assuring that your prescribing allergist provides the information\nwe need in a timely manner. We are available to answer questions they may have in completing the documentation.\nFirst appointment. Upon receipt and review of information from your prescribing allergist, we will contact you to\nschedule your first appointment with one of our providers. Please note: The appointment will not be scheduled until we\nhave received the information from your allergist.\nInjection visits. Injections are administered on a scheduled basis. You may receive your injections during days and\ntimes when your prescribing allergist’s office is open. This is necessary in the event we need to contact your allergist\nabout your injections or reactions you may have experienced. We will not administer injections to you during days and\ntimes when your allergist’s office is closed. You will need to sign the Allergy Injection Consent.\nYour injection schedule. Your prescribing allergist will determine your treatment schedule and frequency of your allergy\ninjections. It is your responsibility to maintain that schedule, so you do not fall behind in treatment. If you arrive for an\ninjection and have fallen behind in treatment necessitating that we contact your allergist for dosing instructions, you will\nnot receive your injection that day. After we have received instructions from your allergist, we will contact you to receive\nyour injection. Due to the importance of receiving injections on a regular basis and the disruption caused when falling\nbehind in treatment, patients who do so more than twice in the year will not be able to receive their injections in our office.\nAfter injection wait time. Following your injection, we require that you wait 30 minutes in our office. This allows us to\nmonitor you for any reaction that may occur following the injection. If you fail to wait the required 30 minutes, we will\ndiscontinue your treatment.\nAnnual Wellness visits. Prior to receiving your first injection at our office, you will need to be seen by one of our\nproviders to establish yourself as a patient. The provider will obtain your medical history and perform a brief examination.\nEach year thereafter you will need a wellness visit at our office to update your medical history. This is necessary so that\nwe have current medical information in the event we need to treat you for a reaction to your injections or for allergies\nwhile you are in the area.\nAt the end of your time with us you are responsible for picking up your vials and returning them to your prescribing allergist.\nIf you have questions, please contact our office at 412-268-2157, option 2. We will be pleased to assist you.\n\nImportant information for your Allergist. Please enter your name and birthdate and provide these documents\nto your allergist.\nDear Doctor:\nYour patient DOB , has requested to receive allergy\n(insert your name) (insert your date of birth)\ninjections in our office using treatment vials provided by your office.\nPlease note there are certain considerations for patients requesting to receive their injections in our office,\nwhich we have outlined below.\n• Patient vial labels must be typewritten and contain an expiration date. Handwritten labels and “cross\nouts” are not acceptable.\n• Injection records must be legible and contain unequivocal dosing instructions. These instructions must\ninclude directions for increasing patients through to their maintenance dose (interval and dose amount)\nand instructions for dose reductions if the patient is “late” for their injection or provided new vials\n• The patient will be permitted to receive injections only during the operating hours of your office. This\npermits us to contact you if needed for consultation.\nPlease complete the Allergy Injection Information from the Prescribing Allergist form and return it to us as\nsoon as possible to allow time for review and follow up with your office if necessary.

Part of caring for peers is paying attention to how they are doing emotionally and physically.\n\nStudents and developing adults experience a range of emotions, including stress. It is important to be aware when someone is in distress, manifesting itself in ways that affect lifestyle or normal function.\n\nDistress feels different for everybody.  As a friend, you may notice when someone is in distress when you notice changes in their normal routine or way of thinking or feeling.\n\nHere is a list of symptoms or changes you may observe.  This list is not exhaustive but it can give you a good starting point on things to pay attention to:\n\nIf you have identified a friend who you think is in distress or going through a tough time, or a friend has approached you seeking support, here are a few suggestions on how to help.\n\nA crisis is subjective and personal and it can range from mild to life-threatening. When a person is in an emotional crisis, it should always be taken seriously and we encourage you to respond in a caring and immediate way. Here are a few examples of what you may see or hear from a person going through a crisis:\n\nCall immediately for assistance if someone you know is exhibiting some of the above behaviors or you believe the person might harm him/herself or someone else. If it feels safe to do so, remain with the person until she or he is connected to professional help.  Phone numbers to use:\n\nIf student resides on campus, call CMU Police at 412-268-2323.\n\nIf student resides off campus, call Pittsburgh Police at 911 (if calling from Pittsburgh area) or 412-255-2927 (if calling from out of town).\n\nWe encourage students to be active members of the CMU community, attending to and caring for others around you. However, we also want you to take care of yourself and maintain healthy boundaries. Your own well-being is as important as that of the person in distress. In helping others, it is important to be aware of your own needs and recognize the limits of what you can or cannot do.\n\nYou don’t have to do this alone. If you are genuinely concerned for someone or you see someone in distress, it may be a good idea to contact someone else to share your concerns with (e.g., friends, staff member, family member, professor, coach, therapist).\n\nYou may contact CaPS directly to seek advice on how to handle the situation.\n\nCaPS 24/7 After-hours Support: 412-268-2922You can also stop by our office during regular hours, Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. – 4 p.m.\n\nPlease be aware that we are bound by law to protect confidentiality of anyone receiving our services. We do not share any personal information unless a student has signed a consent form or information is needed to protect safety. If you would like to talk to someone at CaPS regarding your student’s well-being, ask your student to sign a Release of Information form (ROI).\n\nIf a student does not sign an ROI, you may still call CaPS to share your concerns. We welcome information that might help a student when there are urgent psychological or emotional concerns. The therapist can listen to your concerns and consult about general issues that do not pertain to your student directly. Note, however, that the therapist will not be able to acknowledge that your student is engaged in services at CaPS nor provide you with any personal information.\n\nWe encourage you to follow up with the student after you have made a referral. Ideally, the student will talk with you directly to let you know how they are doing after the referral.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• Sleep – difficulties falling asleep, difficulties sleeping throughout the night, sleeping too much, not wanting to get out of bed, avoiding sleep by staying up all night.\n• Appetite – eating more, eating less, or choosing foods different from normal habits.\n• Social Withdrawal – withdrawing from family and friends (not wanting to talk to them or see them), staying by oneself, avoiding social situations, avoiding classes.\n• Focus/Concentration – difficulty paying attention in class, difficulties focusing on assignments, having to reread the same paragraph over and over again in order to understand the reading.\n• Mood – sad, irritable, anxious, restless, worried, hopeless.\n• Energy Level – sustained decrease in energy level and motivation, or having too much energy (e.g., unable to sleep or turn off thoughts).\n• Behavior Changes – acting differently than usual (e.g., talking back at people, “not caring” attitude, not performing as usual, not engaging in activities formally enjoyed, increased substance abuse, engaging in other self destructive behavior).\n\n• Take the person aside and talk to him/her in private. Try to give the other person your undivided attention. Just a few minutes of listening might enable him or her to make a decision about what to do.\n• Be honest and direct, but nonjudgmental. Take the initiative to ask what is troubling your friend and attempt to overcome reluctance to talk about it.\n• Share what you have observed and why it concerns you. For example: \"I've noticed that you've been missing class a lot lately and you aren't answering your phone or text messages like you used to. I'm worried about you.\"\n• Listen carefully and with sensitivity. Listen in an open minded and nonjudgmental way.\n• Note that distress often comes from conflicting feelings or demands. Acknowledge this, and from time to time, paraphrase what the other person is saying, which communicates your efforts to support and understand him/her. For example: \"It sounds like on the one hand, you very much want to please your family, but on the other hand, you aren't sure that what they want for you is what you really want to do.\"\n• Encourage. Encourage the person to take care of themselves, to be around friends, to sleep, to engage in activities that are enjoyable to them.  Moreover,  keep the lines of communication open so they feel comfortable talking to you again.\n• Make a referral. Encourage the person to consider visiting CaPS when their distress does not decrease within an appropriate period of time or it increases, when they seem to be struggling to reach out for help, or when  you feel your ability to assist has reached its limit. Consider offering to call CaPS with them or walk over with them if they are in immediate need of support. Please call ahead if possible.\n• Follow up. Let the person know that you'll be checking back with him or her later to see how things turned out.\n• Responding in a caring way. This can help the person feel less lonely and more hopeful. It can also prevent the distressed person's situation from escalating into a crisis.\n\n• Extreme agitation or panic\n• References to or threats of suicide, or other types of self-harm\n• Threats of assault, both verbal and physical\n• Highly disruptive behavior: physical or verbal hostility, violence, destruction of property\n• Inability to communicate (e.g., slurred or garbled speech, disjointed thoughts)\n• Disorientation, confusion, loss of contact with conventional reality\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsiblity\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Professional Training\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• Â© 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• Get Support\n    \n\n                      Support For Yourself\n    \n\n                      For Someone Else\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n• Services\n    \n\n                      Gender Affirming Care\n    \n\n                      Let's Talk\n    \n\n                      Consultation\n    \n\n                      Groups & Skills Clinics\n    \n\n                      Individual Therapy\n    \n\n                      Outreach Prevention & Education\n    \n\n                      Psychiatric Care\n    \n\n                      Referrals\n    \n\n                      Tele-Mental Health\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n• TimelyCare\n• Resources\n• Professional Training\n• Get Involved\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n    \n\n                      Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Contact CaPS\n• About CaPS\n    \n\n                      Frequently Asked Questions\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• CaPS Event D-List Sign Up\n\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2922\nPhone: 412-255-2927\nPhone: 412-268-2323",

Explore these grounding strategies to calm your nervous system\n\n[H3] Campus Confidential Reporting Resources:\n\n[H3] Campus Mandated Reporting Resources:\n\nThe term \"sexual violence\" is an all-encompassing, non-legal term that refers to crimes like sexual assault, rape, and sexual abuse. If someone forces or manipulates someone else into any kind of unwanted sexual activity without their consent, it is sexual violence. Reasons someone may not be able to consent include fear, age, illness, disability, and/or influence of alcohol or other drugs. Many definitions related to consent and sexual violence may be found on The Office of Institutional Equity & Title IX’s webpage.\n\nAnyone can experience sexual violence, and it is never their fault. If you are unsure if what you have experienced or are experiencing is considered sexual violence, you can schedule a confidential meeting with CaPS, or connect with Pittsburgh Action Against Rape (PAAR) or Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) to talk with someone who can listen and help.\n\nWe recommend receiving immediate attention and care in the emergency department following a sexual trauma. If you are in Pittsburgh, UPMC Magee is the best option. Your insurance will not be charged, and you won’t have to pay for any medications. In the emergency department you can receive care and complete evidence collection, regardless of whether you report to police or not. In the emergency department, you have access to:\n\nIt is important to follow up with UHS clinicians, your primary care provider or an outpatient clinic. If you would like help in connecting to a provider, contact PAAR: 1-866-363-7273.\n\nA sexual assault exam (sometimes called the “kit”) is a medical exam and collection of forensic evidence. It attempts to collect evidence to use in the prosecution of an alleged sexual assault. You can complete the exam/(have evidence collected) with or without reporting the incident to police.\n\nA forensic exam can do two things:\n\nThe sooner you get to the hospital after an assault, the more options are available to you. It is recommended that you go to the hospital within 7 days of the incident. Try not to bathe, shower, brush your teeth, or go to the bathroom. This is important for preserving evidence. If you already have, it is still possible to collect evidence.\n\nIn-person support is available 24 hours a day in emergency departments throughout Allegheny County. PAAR provides in-person support and information during the sexual assault exam. To request that an advocate meet you at the hospital, contact PAAR’s Helpline at 1-866-END-RAPE (1-866-363-7273).\n\nEmergency Contraception (EC) is a safe way to prevent pregnancy following a sexual assault, after unprotected sex or when a contraceptive method may have failed (eg. a condom breaking or missing two or more birth control pills).\n\nImportant Information:\n\nEC is available for $7 in all of the three Wellness to Go vending machines on campus. More information about EC is available here.\n\nSexual assault could expose someone to Sexually Transmitted Infection (STIs). Emergency departments will offer prophylactic medication to prevent STIs and HIV following a sexual assault.\n\nPost-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention\n\nPost-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is a regimen of antiretroviral drugs that is designed to isolate the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), stop its replication and the establishment of infection. However, PEP only works to protect you within 72 hours of exposure. If you think you may have been exposed to HIV (through any means), contact Allies for Health + Wellbeing (412- 345-7456) or go to an emergency room within 72 hours to access PEP.\n\nMany people are concerned about using their insurance for STI testing. The following Pittsburgh resources provide free testing services during select days and hours without going through insurance:\n\nIndividuals with marginalized identities are at a greater risk for sexual violence. Those with multiple marginalized identities are at the greatest risk. Oppression, bias, stereotypes, and access to basic needs like housing, food, healthcare are contributing factors to these disparities. More information around statistics may be found here.\n\nIdentity Specific Organizations:\n\nThe needs and experiences of survivors and communities are varied. The following organizations focus specifically on meeting the unique needs of specific communities and groups:\n\nTitle IX is a U.S. civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education. The Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX is responsible for coordinating the University’s effort’s to prevent and effectively respond to all forms of gender discrimination (including gender identity discrimination) and sexual misconduct impacting community members, including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, dating and domestic violence, and stalking.\n\nIt’s hard to know what to do, how to feel, or what your options are after a sexual assault. Please know that you’re not alone. If you are in immediate danger or seriously injured, call 911. Below are some things to keep in mind.\n\nWhen you call the National Sexual Assault Hotline, a staff member will walk you through the process of getting help at your own pace. You can also visit online.rainn.org to chat anonymously. Support specialists can also provide information on topics you might have questions about.\n\nHelp and support are available regardless of when the violence may have occurred or if the statute of limitations for prosecution has ended. Consider connecting with Pittsburgh Action Against Rape and the National Sexual Assault Hotline to understand what resources best suit your needs.\n\nAnyone can make a report for themselves or someone else with the Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX by completing the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX Report Form, calling, emailing, or visiting the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX.\n\nIf staff and faculty know about an incident, they are required to submit a report to the Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX. Read more about this process under “Resources and Support - Confidentiality.”\n\nWhen the University receives a report of sexual misconduct or other types of discrimination, the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX will:\n\nYou choose what happens next. In very limited circumstances, the University may be required to take additional steps to protect the campus community. For example, the University may need to investigate if there are multiple reports of similar conduct against one individual. Additionally, if there is a crime reported to have occurred on or near campus that represents a possible threat to the community, University Police may need to send out a “timely warning” to the community; the warning will not include identifying information about the impacted party.\n\nWhat’s the difference between a report and a formal complaint?\n\nThe Office accepts reports of prohibited conduct from anyone at any time. A report is information provided to the Office regarding one or more incidents of prohibited conduct. Whether the person making the report decides to pursue an investigation or other resolution, or to not take any further action, is ultimately up to their own discretion. A Formal Complaint is a signed, written or typed document, requesting that the University initiate a formal investigation into the alleged prohibited misconduct.\n\nFor more detailed information regarding University reporting, formal complaints, and investigative processes, contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX office. You may review this resource guide for more detailed information.\n\nThere is never one way to heal from trauma or complex trauma and healing can often be confusing, difficult and nonlinear. It is okay to struggle or seek help from others when healing from sexual violence. Fortunately, there are many different types of resources available. If you have any questions about what types of resources will be the most helpful for you, here are some people you can talk to: Peer Health Advocates, CAPS, or Health Promotion.\n\nFaculty and staff in higher education are either mandated reporters or confidential reporters. What this means is that if sexual violence is disclosed to a faculty or staff person, regardless of whether the incident just happened, or occurred years in the past, faculty and staff must report the incident to The Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX.\n\nIf someone is a confidential reporter, then that report can be made without any details or identifiable information.\n\nIf someone is a mandated reporter, then that report must contain identifying information. A staff member from The Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX will reach out to the person identified in the report. It is up to that person to respond or not. If someone chooses not to respond, then that is the end of the process.\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• Checking for injuries and receiving medical attention\n• Completing a sexual assault exam to collect evidence\n• Receiving emergency contraception and prophylactic medication to prevent STIs and HIV\n\n• provide sensitive, thorough medical care after an alleged sexual assault including physical exam and medication to prevent sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy if applicable\n• collect evidence that is admissible in court and may be helpful to the prosecution of a legal case, in the case that you decide to report to law enforcement\n\n• If possible, do not change your clothes.

PHAs are now paid employees of University Health Services, working as liaisons and a resource for campus health and well-being.\n\nAdditionally, the program has shifted from group education to a one-on-one support model, including text support, drop-in visits, and scheduled consultations.\n\nThe PHAs engage in their support of students using a specialist model, including but not limited to the following areas:\n\nIn addition to the undergraduate program, graduate students are now active in PHA roles to support graduate student health and wellbeing.\n\nThe PHA program offers a credited mini-course that teaches the foundations of peer education (99-121). Course enrollment is open to all students and required for PHAs.\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• Practice setting and communicating boundaries\n• Navigating on and off campus resources\n• Brainstorming mindfulness and meditation tools\n• Reviewing and demonstrating safer sex tools\n• Generating tasty, satisfying, and accessible meal and snack ideas\n\n• Disability Resources\n• Sexual Health\n• Mindfulness and Mental Health\n• Nutrition\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsibility\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\n• Disability Resources\n• Title IX Initiatives\n• University Police\n• University Policies\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• © 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Facebook\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• HealthConnect\n• New Students\n• Family & Parents\n• Student Insurance\n    \n\n                      Enroll in the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Waive the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Change or Cancel the SHIP \n    \n\n                      SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n    \n\n                      SHIP Rates & Billing\n    \n\n                      Using the SHIP\n    \n\n                      International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n    \n\n                      Insurance Literacy\n    \n\n                      Contacts & Common Questions\n    \n\n                      Leaving CMU\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n• Services & Fees\n    \n\n                      COVID19 \n    \n\n                      Sexual Assault Resources\n    \n\n                      LGBTQIA+ Health\n    \n\n                      Sexual Health\n    \n\n                      Allergy Injections\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n• Health Education & Resources\n    \n\n                      Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n    \n\n                      Local Healthcare Resources\n    \n\n                      Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n    \n\n\n\n                      Recovery and Harm Reduction\n    \n\n                      Wellness To Go Machines\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n• About Us\n    \n\n                      UHS News\n    \n\n                      Who We Are\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n\n• Information for PHAs\n\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 888-796-8226\nPhone: 412-268-2922\nPhone: 412-268-2157\nEmail: cmupha@andrew.cmu.edu",

Please review the following details regarding health records, health insurance, and online courses.\n\nAll new students to the Pittsburgh & Silicon Valley campuses must submit required health forms and immunization information, including uploading a CMU Immunization Record Form signed by their healthcare provider before arriving on campus.\n\nStudents should log into HealthConnect and select Medical Clearances to review and submit all required health information. New fall students can access HealthConnect after commencement, in mid-May.\n\nFailure to comply with the below requirements will result in administrative suspension and removal from university housing.\n\nNew students must enter all immunization doses and dates, and upload the CMU Immunization Record Form (signed by a health care provider) in HealthConnect\n\nNew fall semester students must submit immunization information by August 1.\n\nNew spring semester students must submit immunization information by December 1.\n\nMeasles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR)\n\nVaricella (Chickenpox)\n\nMeningococcal AYWC (applies to students living in university housing)\n\nTuberculosis (TB) Screening Form\n\nThe following nearby pharmacies offer Varicella, Meningitis, and MMR vaccines on a walk-in basis and are in-network for CMU SHIP (so the vaccines are fully covered for students with CMU SHIP):\n\nCVS MinuteClinic\n\nGiant Eagle Market District Pharmacy\n\nGiant Eagle Pharmacy\n\nAllegheny County Health Department Immunization Clinic is another local option for vaccines.\n\nAfter commencement, new students can access all of our online forms and upload records in HealthConnect, under Medical Clearances in the left menu.\n\nPlease note: in order to access HealthConnect, your birthdate in the Student Information System (SIO) must be correct. If you are unable to access HealthConnect, check your birthdate in SIO. If it is incorrect, correct it at the HUB. The following day, it should be updated in HealthConnect. If you still have problems, email us for help.\n\nYes, if vaccination is not advised for medical reasons or conflicts with your religious belief/strong moral or ethical conviction. You can find and submit a vaccine exemption form in HealthConnect, under Downloadable Forms, or find them below:\n\nApplication for Personal or Religious Belief Exemption\n\nApplication for Medical Exemption\n\nIf a contagious disease outbreak occurs, the University reserves the right to ask students who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until the outbreak is over.\n\nAll full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. must have medical insurance that meets university requirements; certain programs also require this of their part-time students. Students must fullfil CMU's insurance mandate during their Open Enrollment period.\n\nPrior to a student's Open Enrollment period, a placeholder fee for the CMU Medical SHIP is posted on their student account. This charge is credited back for students who apply for and receive an approved waiver during open enrollment.\n\nThe CMU Student Health Insurance Medical Plan (CMU SHIP) is available to CMU undergraduate and graduate students, and their eligible dependents, during their Open Enrollment period. Optional vision and dental plans are also available.\n\nStudents must enroll in CMU SHIP or apply for a waiver each academic year, during their Open Enrollment period. Students who do not take action to either enroll or waive will be auto-enrolled in the medical CMU SHIP.\n\nAddtional questions?  Review our Common Questions page.\n\nIf You Enroll in the CMU SHIP\n\nThe insurance premium fees will remain on your student account. If you enroll in the vision or dental plans, or add dependents, the additional charges will be posted to your account once the enrollments have been processed.\n\nIf You Apply for a Waiver\n\nIf your current insurance meets university requirements you may apply for a SHIP waiver. If approved, the student insurance charge will be credited back to the your student account.\n\nIf You Take No Action (not recommended)\n\nIf you do not enroll in SHIP, or apply for a waiver, during your Open Enrollment period, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU Medical SHIP, and the insurance premium fee will remain on your student account. And starting in Fall 25, auto-enrollments will also incur a $50 processing fee.\n\nWaiting for this default-enrollment will delay access to your insurance details, so it is not recommended. If you intend to enroll in the student health insurance plan, please complete the steps to enroll during your Open Enrollment period.\n\nHealth and safety are critically important to the student experience, both in and out of the classroom. All new undergraduate students must complete online courses about substance use safety and sexual violence prevention. Incoming undergraduate students will receive access on Canvas on July 15th to two courses: Safer Scotties- Navigating Substance Use and Safer Scotties- Healthy Relationships. Incoming students should complete these courses by August 16th.\n\nHaving issues with the course?

For the CMU SHIP, most copays are $0-$25. Some services have a higher copay, such as advanced imaging ($40), emergency room visits ($125), and hospital admissions ($150). You must pay the copay once for each visit where it is applicable. Prescriptions also incur a copay, but copays depend on the type of medication and frequency of refill.\n\nA deductible is the amount of money you pay for health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay covered expenses. It is important to review insurance plans so you are aware if there is a deductible or not. Once the deductible is met, the plan will start covering benefits as outlined in the policy.\n\nThe CMU medical SHIP has no deductible for in-network care, but there is a deductible for out-of-network care. The dental SHIP has a deductible for both in-network and out-of-network care.\n\nCoinsurance is a portion of healthcare charges that the member is responsible to pay, usually after a deductible has been met. There is no coinsurance for in-network care with the CMU medical SHIP. For out-of-network care with the CMU SHIP, you would be responsible for 20% of covered charges, after paying the deductible amount. Coinsurance rates vary depending on the plan and the service, so you must review plan(s) carefully.\n\nEOBs show the total charges for your visit and which portion of charges the health insurance plan will cover. EOBs are not bills. EOBs help you understand how much your health plan covers, and what you can expect to pay when you get a bill from your provider.\n\nTHE CMU SHIP is a Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO plan.\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• In-Network providers (doctors) or facilities (laboratories, urgent care centers, hospitals, or imaging centers) participate in your insurance plan network. The most cost effective way to seek care is to see healthcare providers that are in-network. If you have the CMU SHIP and see an in-network provider, there is no deductible.\n• Out-of-Network providers do not participate in your insurance plan network. If you have the CMU medical SHIP and see an out-of-network provider, the plan will cover 80% of the cost of the service after you meet your deductible. The dental plan has different coinsurance rates.\n\n• Students can access their EOBs in the claims section of their Highmark portal.\n\n• A PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) medical plan provides healthcare coverage through a network of providers, and you pay less if you use providers and hospitals within the plan's network. However, you can go outside of the network for an additional cost (see coinsurance).\n• An HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) plan provides healthcare coverage through a network of providers, but you are generally limited to seeing providers within the HMO network for covered services, with limited or no coverage for out-of-network care (except for emergencies). HMO networks are generally limited to the area where the person lived at the time of their enrollment.\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsibility\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\n• Disability Resources\n• Title IX Initiatives\n• University Police\n• University Policies\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• © 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Facebook\n• CMU on Twitter\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• HealthConnect\n• New Students\n• Family & Parents\n• Student Insurance\n    \n\n                      Enroll in the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Waive the SHIP\n    \n\n                      Change or Cancel the SHIP \n    \n\n                      SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n    \n\n                      SHIP Rates & Billing\n    \n\n                      Using the SHIP\n    \n\n                      International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n    \n\n                      Insurance Literacy\n    \n\n                      Contacts & Common Questions\n    \n\n                      Leaving CMU\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n• Services & Fees\n    \n\n                      COVID19 \n    \n\n                      Sexual Assault Resources\n    \n\n                      LGBTQIA+ Health\n    \n\n                      Sexual Health\n    \n\n                      Allergy Injections\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n• Health Education & Resources\n    \n\n                      Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n    \n\n                      Local Healthcare Resources\n    \n\n                      Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n    \n\n\n\n                      Recovery and Harm Reduction\n    \n\n                      Wellness To Go Machines\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n• About Us\n    \n\n                      UHS News\n    \n\n                      Who We Are\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• Enroll in the SHIP\n• Waive the SHIP\n• Change or Cancel the SHIP\n• SHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\n• SHIP Rates & Billing\n• Using the SHIP\n• International, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\n• Insurance Literacy\n• Contacts & Common Questions\n• Leaving CMU\n\n• COVID19\n• Sexual Assault Resources\n• LGBTQIA+ Health\n• Sexual Health\n• Allergy Injections\n\n• Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\n• Local Healthcare Resources\n• Peer Health Advocates\n    \n\n                      Information for PHAs\n• Information for PHAs\n• Recovery and Harm Reduction\n• Wellness To Go Machines\n\n• Information for PHAs\n\n• UHS News\n• Who We Are\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2157",

Please review the following details regarding health records, health insurance, and online courses.\n\nAll new students to the Pittsburgh & Silicon Valley campuses must submit required health forms and immunization information, including uploading a CMU Immunization Record Form signed by their healthcare provider before arriving on campus.\n\nStudents should log into HealthConnect and select Medical Clearances to review and submit all required health information. New fall students can access HealthConnect after commencement, in mid-May.\n\nFailure to comply with the below requirements will result in administrative suspension and removal from university housing.\n\nNew students must enter all immunization doses and dates, and upload the CMU Immunization Record Form (signed by a health care provider) in HealthConnect\n\nNew fall semester students must submit immunization information by August 1.\n\nNew spring semester students must submit immunization information by December 1.\n\nMeasles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR)\n\nVaricella (Chickenpox)\n\nMeningococcal AYWC (applies to students living in university housing)\n\nTuberculosis (TB) Screening Form\n\nThe following nearby pharmacies offer Varicella, Meningitis, and MMR vaccines on a walk-in basis and are in-network for CMU SHIP (so the vaccines are fully covered for students with CMU SHIP):\n\nCVS MinuteClinic\n\nGiant Eagle Market District Pharmacy\n\nGiant Eagle Pharmacy\n\nAllegheny County Health Department Immunization Clinic is another local option for vaccines.\n\nAfter commencement, new students can access all of our online forms and upload records in HealthConnect, under Medical Clearances in the left menu.\n\nPlease note: in order to access HealthConnect, your birthdate in the Student Information System (SIO) must be correct. If you are unable to access HealthConnect, check your birthdate in SIO. If it is incorrect, correct it at the HUB. The following day, it should be updated in HealthConnect. If you still have problems, email us for help.\n\nYes, if vaccination is not advised for medical reasons or conflicts with your religious belief/strong moral or ethical conviction. You can find and submit a vaccine exemption form in HealthConnect, under Downloadable Forms, or find them below:\n\nApplication for Personal or Religious Belief Exemption\n\nApplication for Medical Exemption\n\nIf a contagious disease outbreak occurs, the University reserves the right to ask students who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until the outbreak is over.\n\nAll full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. must have medical insurance that meets university requirements; certain programs also require this of their part-time students. Students must fullfil CMU's insurance mandate during their Open Enrollment period.\n\nPrior to a student's Open Enrollment period, a placeholder fee for the CMU Medical SHIP is posted on their student account. This charge is credited back for students who apply for and receive an approved waiver during open enrollment.\n\nThe CMU Student Health Insurance Medical Plan (CMU SHIP) is available to CMU undergraduate and graduate students, and their eligible dependents, during their Open Enrollment period. Optional vision and dental plans are also available.\n\nStudents must enroll in CMU SHIP or apply for a waiver each academic year, during their Open Enrollment period. Students who do not take action to either enroll or waive will be auto-enrolled in the medical CMU SHIP.\n\nAddtional questions?  Review our Common Questions page.\n\nIf You Enroll in the CMU SHIP\n\nThe insurance premium fees will remain on your student account. If you enroll in the vision or dental plans, or add dependents, the additional charges will be posted to your account once the enrollments have been processed.\n\nIf You Apply for a Waiver\n\nIf your current insurance meets university requirements you may apply for a SHIP waiver. If approved, the student insurance charge will be credited back to the your student account.\n\nIf You Take No Action (not recommended)\n\nIf you do not enroll in SHIP, or apply for a waiver, during your Open Enrollment period, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU Medical SHIP, and the insurance premium fee will remain on your student account. And starting in Fall 25, auto-enrollments will also incur a $50 processing fee.\n\nWaiting for this default-enrollment will delay access to your insurance details, so it is not recommended. If you intend to enroll in the student health insurance plan, please complete the steps to enroll during your Open Enrollment period.\n\nHealth and safety are critically important to the student experience, both in and out of the classroom. All new undergraduate students must complete online courses about substance use safety and sexual violence prevention. Incoming undergraduate students will receive access on Canvas on July 15th to two courses: Safer Scotties- Navigating Substance Use and Safer Scotties- Healthy Relationships. Incoming students should complete these courses by August 16th.\n\nHaving issues with the course?

Enrollments and waivers do not carry over from the previous academic year.\n\nTo qualify for a waiver, students must verify that they have active medical insurance that meets university requirements. All insurance plans must be active for the duration of your time as an enrolled student. Students (and families where applicable) are responsible for reviewing these requirements and verifying that their medical insurance meets them.\n\nWaiver applications must be submitted by the student, through the insurance portal in SIO, prior to a student's Open Enrollment deadline. If approved, the student insurance charge will be credited back to the student's account. With an approved waiver, a student accepts full financial liability for any medical costs incurred. If a waiver is not approved (because the plan does not meet university requirements), the student must enroll in the CMU student medical insurance plan.\n\nLate waiver applications will be accepted for two weeks after a student's Open Enrollment deadline, and are subject to a $50 late fee.\n\nStudents who have extenuating circumstances and wish to request a waiver beyond the two-week late period must submit a formal appeal. Submitting an appeal does not guarantee that a waiver will be approved, but does allow a student's circumstances to be considered. If an appeal is granted and the waiver is approved, the student will be responsible for paying the student medical plan premium for the months of enrollment. Waiver appeals are not accepted after 90 days from a student's Open Enrollment deadline. Contact the Student Health Insurance Team  for late waiver requests and appeals.\n\nIn order to waive CMU's Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), all full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. must have health insurance that meets the following requirements:\n\nStudents must have continuous medical insurance coverage for their duration of time as an enrolled student. The insurance plan must be in force for the academic year/semester (whichever applies) to ensure there is no gap in coverage:\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• Part-time students who wish to waive SHIP only need to provide proof of active insurance. The insurance plan does not need to meet all university requirements for a waiver.\n• Study Abroad students should refer to our study abroad section for additional waiver details.\n\n• Jul 1 - Aug 22\n                                Fall Open Enrollment: for all new and returning CMU students\n\n• During Open Enrollment: log into SIO > Campus Life > Health Insurance\n• Click the enroll/waive portal link\n• Choose the option to waive\n• Fill out your details and upload the front and back of your current medical insurance card\n• Click CONFIRM on the final screen to submit\n\n• is provided by a company licensed to do business in the United States, with a U.S. claims payment office and a U.S. phone number;\n• has unlimited annual and lifetime benefits (i.e., no policy maximum);\n• will be in force for the duration of your time as a student for the academic year/semester (whichever applies);\n• has a maximum deductible of $5,000 individual/$10,000 family.

That is why all full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. are required to meet CMU's health insurance mandate each academic year.\n\nTo fulfill this mandate students must have insurance that meets university requirements for the duration of their time as an enrolled student, either through enrolling in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), or obtaining a SHIP waiver:\n\nSHIP Eligibility\n\nAll full-time and part-time degree-seeking Carnegie Mellon students, and their eligible dependents, are eligible to enroll in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) during their Open Enrollment period.  Students can also enroll in the SHIP, or add eligible dependents to their existing SHIP enrollments, outside of Open Enrollment due to a Qualifying Life Event (QLE).\n\nOpen Enrollment is the period during which students must enroll in the CMU SHIP or apply to waive it. SHIP enrollments, and waiver applications, are submitted through the insurance portal in Student Information Online (SIO).\n\nHow to submit and enrollment/waiver during Open Enrollment\n\nStudents who do not take any action to enroll in, or waive, the CMU SHIP during their Open Enrollment period will be auto-enrolled into the CMU SHIP medical plan.\n\nWe strongly recommend that students do not wait to be auto-enrolled:\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• The enroll/waive process must be completed during a student's Open Enrollment period.\n\nSHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n• SHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n• If you do not have insurance that meets university requirements you must enroll in the medical SHIP.\n• By default, a SHIP placeholder charge is posted to your student account, until you complete Open Enrollment.\n• If you do not complete Open Enrollment you will be auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP.  Auto enrollments are not recommended, and beginning in Fall 25 will incur a $50 processing fee.\n\n• SHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.\n\n• Open Enrollment\n• CMU Insurance Waiver Requirements\n• SHIP Rates\n• SHIP Coverage & Plan Documents\n• Insurance Frequently Asked Questions\n\n• Open Enrollment periods correspond with a student's first active semester at CMU each academic year.\n• Students who do not enroll or waive during their Open Enrollment period are auto-enrolled in the medical SHIP (not recommended).\n• By default, a placeholder charge for the CMU SHIP is posted to each student's account.\n\nDuring Open Enrollment this placeholder charge, and payment of this fee, does not indicate a SHIP enrollment. \nStudents who apply for and receive an approved waiver will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.\nStudents who enroll in the SHIP will have the placeholder charge credited back to their account.

Know what to do!\n\nInfluenza (or flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by flu viruses. Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs. If you get flu symptoms, in most cases, you should stay home and avoid contact with others except to get medical care.\n\nKnow the Symptoms of Flu\n\nFlu viruses can cause mild to severe illness, and at can lead to death. The flu is different from a cold. The flu usually come on suddenly.\n\nPeople who have the flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: fever* or feeling feverish/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue (tiredness). Some people have vomiting and diarrhea, which is more common in children.\n\n*It's important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever.\n\nTake antiviral drugs if your doctor prescribes them.\n\nAntiviral drugs can be used to treat flu illness. Antiviral drugs can make illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu complications.\n\nCDC recommends that antiviral drugs be used early to treat people who are very sick with the flu and people who get flu symptoms who are at high risk of serious flu complications, either because of their age or because they have a high risk medical condition.\n\nStay home when sick.\n\nWhen you are sick, limit  contact with others as much as possible. Remember to cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when your cough or sneeze, and throw tissues in the trash after you use them. Stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities.\n\nYour fever should be gone for 24 hours without the use of a fever-reducing medicine before resuming normal activities.\n\nSymptom onset\n\nFatigue, weakness\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• If you have cold and flu symptoms, please schedule with Tartan Testing, a local pharmacy, or UHS to get screened for COVID-19.\n• If you are negative for COVID, it is possible you have the flu or a cold.\n• You do not need to be tested for flu, but please stay home and isolate to reduce spreading to others, until 24 hours without a fever.\n• You do not have to be seen by a medical provider for the flu unless you are severely ill or short of breath.\n• Please wear a facial covering around others until you are symptom free.\n• Wash your hands often to keep from spreading flu to others.\n• Drink lots of fluids and take acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed for pain and/or fever.\n• If it is less than two days since you’ve been sick and high risk, please call UHS to ask about taking anti-viral medications.\n• Feel free to call UHS nurses to ask for advice (412-268-2157, option 2).\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education &

International students struggle disproportionately with mental health issues, as they face additional pressures and stressors in their transition to college life. In addition to transition stressors, international students often have to:\n\nWhile academic stressors often impact university students, international students may experience the effects more intensely than domestic students. Coming to the United States creates additional stress, as students navigate wide-ranging life changes from differences in climate, dietary options, transportation, language ability, or lifestyle choices. This can oftentimes lead to culture shock.\n\nFor many international students, studying in the U.S. means they are now apart from the social supports like academic advice and social outlets in their native country. Furthermore, if a student has low English proficiency, it can cause anxiety as they struggle to perform at the high academic levels that they achieved previously in their native language. Friends serve as a surrogate family for students in a new country, and the lack of language needed to make friends may be a significant obstacle for the international students as they adjust. Additionally, some international students may find the teaching styles in the American classrooms different from the lecture style they were accustomed to in their home country. The disparity in educational services provided could lead to unfulfilled expectations on the part of international students, which can lead to mental health stressors.\n\nThese transitions may come with feelings of anxiety, sadness, isolation and being overwhelmed. Sometimes, these feelings might be expressed physically, such as experiencing headaches, difficulty focusing, loss of appetite, or physical pain that may be unfamiliar or uncommon for you. Typically, transitional stress decreases with the passage of time in the new culture, with accessing resources and building a community of support.\n\nBecause the international student population is incredibly diverse, we recommend you check out the resources we have for the identity that you most align with. Additionally, this page provides CMU specific resources that can help with academic success and connecting with others.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• Adjust to an entirely new culture\n• Face a language barrier that impacts their ability to communicate and connect\n• Live physically farther away from their support network of family and friends\n\n• Office of International Education\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Student Academic Success Center\n• International Student Organizations\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsiblity\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Professional Training\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• Â© 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• Get Support\n    \n\n                      Support For Yourself\n    \n\n                      For Someone Else\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n• Services\n    \n\n                      Gender Affirming Care\n    \n\n                      Let's Talk\n    \n\n                      Consultation\n    \n\n                      Groups & Skills Clinics\n    \n\n                      Individual Therapy\n    \n\n                      Outreach Prevention & Education\n    \n\n                      Psychiatric Care\n    \n\n                      Referrals\n    \n\n                      Tele-Mental Health\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n• TimelyCare\n• Resources\n• Professional Training\n• Get Involved\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Contact CaPS\n• About CaPS\n    \n\n                      Frequently Asked Questions\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• CaPS Event D-List Sign Up\n\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2922",

      "content": "[H1] Information about Flu\n\n[H1] Division of Student Affairs\n\n[H1] UHS Partners\n\n[H2] Student Affairs\n\nMost experts believe that flu viruses spread person to person, mainly by tiny droplets made with people with the flu cough, sneeze, or talk.\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFLUENZA (FLU) AND COVID-19?\n\nSick with the flu? Know what to do!\n\nInfluenza (or flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by flu viruses. Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs. If you get flu symptoms, in most cases, you should stay home and avoid contact with others except to get medical care.\n\nKnow the Symptoms of Flu\n\nFlu viruses can cause mild to severe illness, and at can lead to death. The flu is different from a cold. The flu usually come on suddenly.\n\nPeople who have the flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: fever* or feeling feverish/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue (tiredness). Some people have vomiting and diarrhea, which is more common in children.\n\n*It's important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever.\n\nTake antiviral drugs if your doctor prescribes them.\n\nAntiviral drugs can be used to treat flu illness. Antiviral drugs can make illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu complications.\n\nCDC recommends that antiviral drugs be used early to treat people who are very sick with the flu and people who get flu symptoms who are at high risk of serious flu complications, either because of their age or because they have a high risk medical condition.\n\nStay home when sick.\n\nWhen you are sick, limit  contact with others as much as possible. Remember to cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when your cough or sneeze, and throw tissues in the trash after you use them. Stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities.\n\nYour fever should be gone for 24 hours without the use of a fever-reducing medicine before resuming normal activities.\n\nSymptom onset\n\nFatigue, weakness\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• If you have cold and flu symptoms, please schedule with Tartan Testing, a local pharmacy, or UHS to get screened for COVID-19.\n• If you are negative for COVID, it is possible you have the flu or a cold.\n• You do not need to be tested for flu, but please stay home and isolate to reduce spreading to others, until 24 hours without a fever.\n• You do not have to be seen by a medical provider for the flu unless you are severely ill or short of breath.\n• Please wear a facial covering around others until you are symptom free.\n• Wash your hands often to keep from spreading flu to others.\n• Drink lots of fluids and take acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed for pain and/or fever.\n• If it is less than two days since you’ve been sick and high risk, please call UHS to ask about taking anti-viral medications.\n• Feel free to call UHS nurses to ask for advice (412-268-2157, option 2).\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education &

You will be responsible to pay your dentist the full charge for these uncovered services.\nClasses or service groupings shown with “Plan Pays” percentages greater than 0% but less than 100% require\nyou to pay a portion of the cost for the covered service. For example, if the program pays 80%, your share or\ncoinsurance is 20% of the maximum allowable charge. You are also responsible to pay any deductibles,\ncharges exceeding the program maximums or charges for covered services performed before satisfaction of\nany applicable waiting periods or which are not eligible for payment following the application of program benefit\nlimitations.

MAC charges may vary depending on the geographical area of the dental office and the\ncontract between Highmark or its designated agent and the particular network dentist rendering the service.\nNetwork dentists agree by contract to accept MAC as payment in full for covered services rendered to you.\nYou shall be held harmless if, after receiving services from a network dentist, such services are determined not\nto be dentally necessary.\nPayment For Out-of-Network Covered Expenses\n*ITOCLVL2*Payment For Out-of-Network Covered Expenses*TOCLVLf2* you receive services from an out-of-network dentist, Highmark will send payment for covered benefits to you,\nunless the claim submitted by you indicates that payment should be sent directly to the dentist that performed\nthe services.

You will still be notified whether the services you received are covered, the\nplan payment and any amounts that you owe for coinsurance, deductibles, charges exceeding annual\nmaximums, services not covered due to benefit frequency limitations or charges for services not covered by\nyour program. Highmark's payment will be based on the maximum allowable charges (MAC) for the services.\nOut-of-Network MAC is determined as a percentile of dentist charges for Covered Services by grouping the\n90th percentile of dentist charges into different geographical areas which are used to calculate Highmark's\npayment.You will be responsible to pay the dentist any difference between the plan's payment and the\nout-of-network dentist's full charge for the services. Out-of-network dentists are not obligated to limit their fees\nto the plan's MAC. Dental emergency services performed by an out-of-network dentist will be reimbursed by\nthe plan so that you are not liable for a greater out of pocket expense than if you were treated by a network\ndentist.\n7\n\nDescription of Benefits\n*TEMPLATE*CCBSPA_CERT_DENTAL*TEMPLATE*\n*TTOCLVL1*Description of Benefits*TOCLVL1* he general descriptions below explain the services on the Summary of Benefits.

However, coverage for completion of a dental procedure requiring two\nor more visits on separate days will be extended for a short period of 90 days after the termination date in\norder for the procedure to be finished. The procedure must be started prior to the termination date. The\nprocedure is considered started when the teeth are irrevocably altered. For example, for crowns or fixed partial\ndentures, the procedure is started when the teeth are prepared and impressions are taken. For root canals, the\nprocedure is started when the tooth is opened and pulp is removed. For orthodontic treatment, if covered under\nyour plan, coverage will be extended through the end of the month of the member’s termination date. This\nextension does not apply if the program terminates for failure to pay premium.\nCollege Tuition Reward Program\n*TOCLVL2*College Tuition Reward Program*TOCLVL2*lvl 1. Highmark provides access to a College Tuition Reward Program (\"Program\") made available by\nSAGE CTB LLC (\"Sage\"). Sage represents and has agreements with a consortium of private\ncolleges and universities that participate in the Program.\n2. Participation in the Program is at the sole option of the member.\n3. Members who wish to participate in the Program can earn college tuition reward points that can be\nconverted into equivalent cash credits which may be applied to the tuition expenses that eligible\nstudents incur when attending Sage participating colleges and universities. Credits are earned and\naccumulate during the period in which the member is enrolled under this plan.\n4. Information regarding Program details including a listing of participating colleges and universities\nwill be provided by Sage.\n5. Highmark makes no representations and assumes no liability in connection with the Program or its\nadministration.\nCoordination of Benefits\n*ITOCLVL2*Coordination of Benefits*TOCLVL2*f you or your dependents are covered by any other dental program and receive a service covered by this\nprogram and the other dental program, benefits will be coordinated. This means that one program will be\nprimary and determine its benefits before those of the other program and without considering the other\nprogram's benefits. The other program will be secondary and determine its benefits after the primary program.\nThe secondary program's benefits may be reduced because of the primary program's payment. Each program\nwill provide only that portion of its benefit that is required to cover expenses. This prevents duplicate payments\nand overpayments. Upon determination of primary or secondary liability, this program will determine payment.\nThe following words and phrases regarding the Coordination of Benefits (\"COB\") provision are defined\nas set forth below:\nl Allowable Amount is the program allowance for items of expense, when the care is covered at least in\npart by one or more programs covering the member for whom the claim is made.\n16\n\nl Claim Determination Period means a benefit year. However, it does not include any part of a year\nduring which a person has no coverage under this program.\nl Other Dental Plan is any form of coverage which is separate from this program with which coordination\nis allowed. Other Dental Plan will be any of the following which provides dental benefits, or services, for\nthe following: group insurance or group type coverage, whether insured or uninsured. It also includes\ncoverage other than school accident type coverage (including grammar, high school and college student\ncoverages) for accidents only, including athletic injury, either on a 24-hour basis or on a \"to and from\nschool basis,\" or group or group type hospital indemnity benefits of $100 per day or less.\nl Primary Plan is the program which determines its benefits first and without considering the other\nprogram's benefits. A program that does not include a COB provision may not take the benefits of\nanother program into account when it determines its benefits.\nl Secondary Plan is the program which determines its benefits after those of the other plan (Primary\nPlan). Benefits may be reduced because of the other program's (Primary Plan) benefits.\nl Plan means this document, providing dental care benefits to which this COB provision applies and which\nmay be reduced as a result of the benefits of other dental plans.\nThe fair value of services provided by the Company will be considered to be the amount of benefits\npaid by the Company. The Company will be fully discharged from liability to the extent of such\npayment under this provision.\nIn order to determine which plan is primary, this Plan will use the following rules.\nl If the other plan does not have a provision similar to this one, then that plan will be primary.\nl If both plans have COB provisions, the plan covering the Member as a primary insured is determined\nbefore those of the plan which covers the person as a Dependent.\nl Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divorced -- The rules for the order of benefits for a\nDependent child when the parents are not separated or divorced are:\n¡ The benefits of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before\nthose of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year;\n¡ If both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the plan which covered the parent longer are\ndetermined before those of the plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time;\n¡ The word \"birthday\" refers only to month and day in a calendar year, not the year in which the\nperson was born;\n¡ If the other plan does not follow the birthday rule, but instead has a rule based upon the gender of\nthe parent; and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule based upon\nthe gender of the parent will determine the order of benefits.\nl Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced Parents -- If two or more plans cover a person as Dependent\nchild of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the child are determined in this order:\n¡ First, the plan of the parent with custody of the child.\n¡ Then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; and\n¡ Finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child.\n¡ If the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the dental care\nexpenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the plan of that\nparent has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first. The plan\nof the other parent will be the Secondary Plan.\n¡ If the specific terms of the court decree state that the parents will share joint custody, without stating\nthat one of the parents is responsible for the dental care expenses of the child, the plans covering\nthe child will follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined in the above paragraph, titled\nDependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divorced.\n17\n\nl Active/Inactive Member\n¡ For actively employed Members and their spouses over the age of 65 who are covered by\nMedicare, the plan will be primary.\n¡ When one contract is a retirement plan and the other is an active plan, the active plan is primary.\nWhen two retirement plans are involved, the one in effect for the longest time is primary. If another\ncontract does not have this rule, then this rule will be ignored.\nl If none of these rules apply, then the contract which has continuously covered the Member for a longer\nperiod of time will be primary.\nl The plan covering an individual as a COBRA continuee will be secondary to a plan covering that\nindividual as a Member or a Dependent.\nRight to Receive and Release Needed Information -- Certain facts are needed to apply these COB rules.\nThe Plan has the right to decide which facts it needs. It may get needed facts from or give them to any other\norganization or person. Any health information furnished to a third party will be released in accordance with\nfederal law. Each person claiming benefits under this Plan must give any facts needed to pay the claim.\nFacility of Payment -- A payment made under another plan may include an amount which should have been\npaid under this plan. If it does, the Plan may pay the amount to the organization which made that payment.\nThat amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under this plan, and the Plan will not pay that\namount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case\n\"payment made\" means reasonable cash value of the services prepaid by the Plan.\nRight of Recovery -- If the payment made by the Plan is more than it should have paid under this COB\nprovision, the Plan may recover the excess from one or more of the following: (1) persons it has paid or for\nwhom it has paid; or (2) insurance companies; or (3) other organization. Members are required to assist the\nCompany to implement this section.\nForce Majeure\n*NTOCLVL2*Force Majeure*TOCLVL2* o failure, delay or default in performance of any obligation of Highmark shall constitute an event of default or\nbreach to the extent that such failure to perform, delay or default arises out of a cause, existing or future, that is\nbeyond the reasonable control and not the result of the negligence of Highmark. Such events include, by way\nof illustration and not limitation, Acts of God, war (declared or undeclared), government regulation, acts or\ninaction of governmental authority, civil or military authority, unforeseen disruptions caused by suppliers,\nsubcontractors, vendors or carriers, terrorism, disaster, strikes, civil-disorder, curtailment of transportation\nfacilities, fire, floods, blizzards, epidemics, pandemics, viral or communicable disease outbreaks, National\nEmergency, quarantines, disruption of the labor force and/or any other cause which is beyond the reasonable\ncontrol of Highmark (hereinafter a \"Force Majeure Event\"), that makes it impossible, illegal or commercially\nimpracticable for Highmark to perform its obligations in whole or in part.\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, Highmark shall take action to minimize the consequences of\nthe Force Majeure Event. If Highmark relies on any of the foregoing as an excuse for failure, default or delay in\nperformance, it shall give prompt written notice to the group of the facts that constitute such Force Majeure\nEvent, when it arose and when it is expected to cease.\n18\n\nHow to File a Claim - Dental Program\n*TEMPLATE*CCBSPA_CERT_DENTAL*TEMPLATE*\n*NTOCLVL1*How to File a Claim - Dental Program*TOCLVL1* OTICE OF CLAIM AND PROOF OF LOSS\n*NTOCLVL2*Notice of Claim and Proof of Loss*TOCLVL2* etwork Providers have directly or indirectly entered into an agreement with the Plan pertaining to the payment\nfor Covered Services rendered to a Member.

Predetermination is not required to receive a benefit for any service under the\nprogram. However, it is recommended for extensive, more costly treatment such as crowns and bridges. A\npredetermination gives you and your dentist an estimate of your coverage and how much your share of the\ncost will be for the treatment being considered.\nTo have services predetermined, you or your dentist should submit a claim showing the planned procedures\nbut leaving out the dates of services. Be sure to sign the predetermination request. Substantiating material\nsuch as radiographs and periodontal charting may be requested by Highmark to estimate benefits and\ncoverage. We will determine benefits payable, taking into account exclusions and limitations including alternate\ntreatment options based upon the provisions of the program. We will notify you of the estimated benefits.\nWhen the services are performed, simply have your dentist contact us or fill in the dates of service for the\ncompleted procedures on the predetermination notification and re-submit it to Highmark for processing. Any\n20\n\npredetermination amount estimated is subject to continued eligibility of the patient. We may also make\nadjustments at the time of final payment to correct any mathematical errors, apply coordination of benefits, and\ncomply with your plan in effect and remaining program maximum dollars on the date of service.\nYour Explanation of Benefits Statement\n*WTOCLVL2*Your Explanation of Benefits Statement*TOCLVL2* hen you submit a claim, you will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statement that lists:\nl the provider's actual charge;\nl the allowable amount as determined by Highmark;\nl the copayment; deductible and coinsurance amounts, if any, that you are required to pay;\nl total benefits payable; and\nl the total amount you owe.\nReview of Claim Determination\n*ITOCLVL2*Review of Claim Determination*TOCLVL2*f you are not satisfied with a claim determination or payment, please contact member service at the toll-free\ntelephone number on your dental identification card, If, after speaking with a member service representative,\nyou are still dissatisfied then please see the Appeal Procedure subsection below.\nFiling Benefit Claims\nl Authorized Representatives\nYou have the right to designate an authorized representative to file or pursue a request for\nreimbursement or other post-service claim on your behalf.

Highmark will also notify the provider of any amounts that\nyou are required to pay in the form of a copayment. If you believe that the determination of the\ncopayment amount is not correct or that any portion of those amounts are covered under your benefit\nprogram, you may file a claim to have that amount paid.\nDeterminations on Benefit Claims\n*NTOCLVL2*Determinations on Benefit Claims*TOCLVL2* otice of Adverse Benefit Determinations Involving Requests for Reimbursement and Other Claims\nIf you have submitted a claim for services of an out-of-network provider, Highmark will notify you in writing of its\ndetermination on your request for reimbursement or other claim within a reasonable period of time following\nreceipt of your claim.

If an extension of time is\nnecessary because you failed to submit information necessary for Highmark to make a decision on your claim,\nthe notice of extension that is sent to you will specifically describe the information that you must submit. In this\nevent, you will have at least 45 days in which to submit the information before a decision is made on your\nclaim.\nIf your request for reimbursement or other claim is denied, you will receive written notification of that denial\nwhich will include, among other items, the specific reason or reasons for the adverse benefit determination and\na statement describing your right to file an appeal.\n21\n\nFor a description of your right to file an appeal concerning an adverse benefit determination of a request for\nreimbursement or any other claim, see the Appeal Procedure subsection below.\nAppeal Procedure\n*TTOCLVL2*Appeal Procedure*TOCLVL2* his appeal procedure is effective on the effective date of your program.

She is a Filipino-American child of immigrants and was a first-generation college student. Abigail is passionate about supporting mental health through decreasing stigma, increasing access to care, and using an intersectional and social justice oriented lens in her work. She hopes to empower students to explore, reclaim, and connect with their culture(s) and embrace an identity that is uniquely and authentically theirs.\n\nKym Jordan-Simmons (she/her) is a licensed clinical psychologist more than 20 years of experience at multiple university counseling centers. Kym's clinical interests include co-creating space with students for deeper understanding and healing from racial, family and relational trauma; anxiety; and sexual violence as well as supporting students’ meaningful connection with themselves and others. She is passionate about group therapy and co/facilitates groups for Black Women, PhD students, and students diagnosed with chronic illness. Spending time with family and friends, engaging in public service with her sorors, hula hooping, gardening, and narrating audio books is where she often finds joy.\n\nThis service is open to all CMU undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.

      "content": "[H1] Psychiatric Care\n\n[H1] Division of Student Affairs\n\n[H1] Helpful CaPS Links\n\n[H2] Student Affairs\n\n[H2] What should I expect from my first psychiatric consultation?\n\n[H2] What if I am prescribed medication by CaPS psychiatry?\n\n[H2] What are the costs of psychiatric services?\n\n[H2] What if I am currently prescribed medication from my psychiatrist at home, and I am running out of medication?\n\n[H2] Psychiatry referrals in the community\n\n[H2] Highmark Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) Spring Health Telemedicine platform\n\n[H2] ADHD\n\n[H2] I would like to be evaluated for ADHD. Is there testing at CaPS?\n\n[H2] I have already been diagnosed and am in treatment for ADHD. Can I be seen at CaPS or UHS for continued medication management?\n\nThe psychiatry team at CaPS includes a psychiatrist and a psychiatry triage, consultation and case management (TCC) clinician. CaPS offers short-term psychiatric consultations, medication management, and case management to students who are engaged in therapy at CaPS. Students must be referred to psychiatry services by a member of CaPS staff. For students whose medication needs fall within our scope of practice, we can provide medication management for a limited period (typically 3-6 months) while your team helps you connect with long-term care in the Pittsburgh community and coordinates with your care provider at home. Psychiatry team members collaborate closely with CaPS therapists to provide high-quality and evidence-based care to students, as long-term outcomes are best when medication is combined with therapy in a coordinated approach.\n\nCaPS provides community referrals to students with complex and/or long-term psychiatric needs and for specialized issues like a formal assessment for ADHD medications. CaPS can help you identify and connect with psychiatrists in the community.\n\nIf a CAPS staff member has referred you for psychiatric consultation, then you will be scheduled for an initial one-hour appointment. Prior to that appointment, you will be asked to complete a psychiatric informed consent document and a depression and anxiety questionnaire. The appointment will consist of a diagnostic evaluation, and a recommended treatment plan will be shared after evaluation. We will discuss the risks and benefits of treatment, which may include recommendations for intensity of treatment, types of therapy, and/or medication. It is important to understand that students are a partner in their care and should take an active role in their treatment.\n\nPlease note that an appointment with the psychiatrist does not guarantee students will be prescribed medication.\n\nIf you are prescribed medication as part of your treatment plan at CaPS, you will have regular 20-30 minute follow up appointments every 2-4 weeks until your symptoms improve. The effects and side effects of the medication will be monitored at each visit and adjustments made accordingly. Medication plus therapy together provide the greatest improvement in symptoms and treatment outcomes.\n\nIf you do not have the Highmark SHIP insurance, psychiatric services will be billed to your student account and labeled as \"Student Health Service.\"\n\nStart by calling your current psychiatrist or provider to determine if you can continue treatment or obtain a prescription refill from them. We will assist students with urgent medication refill needs by connecting them with their previous provider or local emergency center for assistance. CaPS does not typically provide emergency medication prescriptions but can assist the student in accessing a facility that may provide emergency prescriptions.\n\nCaPS provides community referrals to students requiring complex and/or long-term psychiatric needs and for specialized issues like a formal assessment for ADHD/ADD medications. We can help you identify and connect with psychiatrists in the community.\n\nPlease refer to your insurance plan’s customer service line for information on psychiatrists in network. If you need more assistance with community psychiatry referrals, CaPS can help you identify and connect with psychiatrists in the community.\n\nFor students with the CMU Highmark SHIP, Spring Health is an option for telepsychiatry and teletherapy. There is typically a relatively short wait time for services and no cost for those with CMU Highmark SHIP. If you have CMU Highmark SHIP, there is no copay for services, but if you have issues with billing please contact Student Health Insurance at shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu. Please refer to your enrollment documentation for more information or click on the link below for the summary of benefits and information about getting started with Spring Health.\n\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/plans.html\n\nHighmark Spring Health\n\nOften, college students have trouble focusing, getting organized or completing work at times of increased stress. If these problems have only started recently (e.g. after coming to undergraduate or graduate school), they are unlikely to be caused by ADHD. ADHD begins in childhood and is not simply a response to stress. Because ADHD begins at an early age and is not episodic, information from parents, physicians and collateral sources is often essential in making a clinical diagnosis. CaPS provides short-term mental health treatment and does not have the resources to provide treatment for students needing long-term treatment for ADHD or other psychiatric disorders.\n\nIf you have been diagnosed and/or treated previously for ADHD, CaPS/UHS requires complete documentation of the diagnostic evaluation and treatment provided by your previous treating physician or other licensed professional. CaPS/UHS may be able to provide medication management if you have been stable on ADHD medication for at least six months, and ADHD is the only psychiatric diagnosis. Contact CaPS for a consultation appointment (412-268-2922) with a TCC clinician to determine your psychiatric needs and most appropriate referrals.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• Initial consultation: $40\n• Follow up appointments: $25\n• Initial evaluation no-show fee: $35\n• Follow up appointment no-show fee: $20\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsiblity\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Professional Training\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• Â© 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• Get Support\n    \n\n                      Support For Yourself\n    \n\n                      For Someone Else\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n• Services\n    \n\n                      Gender Affirming Care\n    \n\n                      Let's Talk\n    \n\n                      Consultation\n    \n\n                      Groups & Skills Clinics\n    \n\n                      Individual Therapy\n    \n\n                      Outreach Prevention & Education\n    \n\n                      Psychiatric Care\n    \n\n                      Referrals\n    \n\n                      Tele-Mental Health\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n• TimelyCare\n• Resources\n• Professional Training\n• Get Involved\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n    \n\n                      Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Contact CaPS\n• About CaPS\n    \n\n                      Frequently Asked Questions\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• CaPS Event D-List Sign Up\n\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2922\nEmail: shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu",

Reach out. Inspire Hope.\n\nEducating yourself and others on suicide and ways to help someone in distress is key to addressing this issue:\n\nNot everyone that is in distress is suicidal. However, it is important to look out for warning signs of a struggling friend or peer. Reaching out to a friend in need and providing emotional support by way of listening can be invaluable. If you are concerned that they are thinking about suicide, the best way to address your concerns is to tell them you are concerned and ask directly if they are thinking about suicide. Many people hesitate, fearing that by asking directly they may offend someone or worse, give them the idea if they haven’t already considered it. While it may feel awkward, it is ALWAYS better to talk directly about your concern and desire to help.\n\nIf you learn that anyone is seriously thinking about suicide, or if you are left with concerns after talking directly with someone in distress, please call CaPS immediately, any time.\n\nSign up for CaPS Pathways for Suicide Prevention Training\n\nGet more information on how to help a friend\n\nView other local and national resources\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• 1 in 10,000 young adults (age 18 to 25) die by suicide each year in the US\n• Most people will contemplate ending their own life at some point in their lives\n• College students are less likely to die by suicide compared to same age peers not in college\n\n• Suicide Prevention Resource Center\n• Know the Signs\n• The Campaign to Change Direction\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsiblity\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Professional Training\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• Â© 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• Get Support\n    \n\n                      Support For Yourself\n    \n\n                      For Someone Else\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n• Services\n    \n\n                      Gender Affirming Care\n    \n\n                      Let's Talk\n    \n\n                      Consultation\n    \n\n                      Groups & Skills Clinics\n    \n\n                      Individual Therapy\n    \n\n                      Outreach Prevention & Education\n    \n\n                      Psychiatric Care\n    \n\n                      Referrals\n    \n\n                      Tele-Mental Health\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n• TimelyCare\n• Resources\n• Professional Training\n• Get Involved\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n    \n\n                      Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Contact CaPS\n• About CaPS\n    \n\n                      Frequently Asked Questions\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• CaPS Event D-List Sign Up\n\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 412-268-2922",

Am I enrolled in the SHIP?\n\n[H2] Additional Common Questions\n\n[H2] I need my insurance ID card. Where can I find my insurance information?\n\n[H2] I do not have a U.S. mailing address yet. Can I enroll in the SHIP?\n\n[H2] If I am graduating in December, can I enroll in the SHIP for August - December only?  Can I enroll only for the months I am on campus?\n\n[H2] I no longer want my student insurance plan/s. Can I cancel the SHIP?\n\n[H2] Outside of Open Enrollment, can I enroll in the medical, dental or vision plans? What if I want to add or remove someone from my plan?\n\n[H2] How do I find in-network health care providers? What if I need to see a doctor or fill a prescription while I am away from campus?\n\n[H2] I am graduating in August. Can I enroll in the SHIP for only the month of August?\n\n[H2] Can I extend the SHIP after graduating in May?\n\n[H2] Why did Highmark send me a letter asking for my Social Security or Tax ID number?\n\n[H3] Mental Health Providers:\n\n[H3] Medical Coverage While Abroad:\n\nSHIP enrollment or waiver status:\n\nQuestions about SHIP coverage (medical procedures, medication, etc.):\n\nQuestions about insurance fees on your student account:\n\nTo update your name, gender, birthdate or mailing address with Highmark:\n\nDepending on the treatment you received, you may have a copay and/or an amount not covered by the insurance plan. The bill from the medical provider will show the charges for the treatment, what your insurance plan has paid and what you owe.\n\nTo start, it is helpful to review the SHIP's Medical Plan Coverage Table, as well as some common insurance terms, in order to better understand what services are covered under the plan.  It is also important to register with Highmark where you can track your medical claims and access your Explanations of Benefits (EOB). The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.\n\nUniversity Health Services (UHS) Charges:\n\nIf you are enrolled in the SHIP and receive care at University Health Services (UHS), many of the fees for our services will be covered by the plan.  If you do owe any fees, those charges will be posted to your student account.\n\nBills from off-campus providers:\n\nIf you see a provider or have a hospital visit outside of UHS, you may receive a bill for non-covered services, and/or copays:\n\nLaboratory Testing:\n\nBills for Ambulance Transport:\n\nThe SHIP covers the cost of emergency ambulance transports, however students are responsible for paying the transport company directly. Highmark will mail you a check for the amount of the transport, once it arrives you have two options:\n\nIf you receive a medical bill and still need assistance, please message the Student Health Insurance Team through HealthConnect, and include a copy of your bill and Explanation of Benefits, if available.\n\nWisdom teeth (third molar) removal is covered under the SHIP Dental Plan and Medical Plan. However, coverage will depend on whether your teeth are soft tissue impacted, or bony impacted.\n\nDental Plan Coverage:\n\nThe SHIP Dental Plan provides benefits for both bony impacted, and soft tissue impacted, wisdom teeth:\n\nYou can review the coverage for third molar removal on the summary of benefits and coverage, located on page 27 of the dental plan book.\n\nMedical Plan Coverage:\n\nThe SHIP Medical Plan only provides benefits for impacted wisdom teeth when partially or totally covered by bone:\n\nYou can review the coverage for third molar removal on page 26 of the medical plan book.\n\nEvaluations & Procedures\n\nBefore having your wisdom teeth removed, you will need to be evaluated. If you have both the SHIP dental plan and medical plan you can get an evaluation from a dentist, or oral surgeon.\n\nThe CMU Medical SHIP provides dental and vision services for students, and their eligible dependents, under the age of 19. This coverage is seperate from the optional dental and vision plans.\n\nPediatric Dental Benefits\n\nPediatric Vision Benefits\n\nClaim forms can be found in the Highmark forms library. Once you have selected the proper form, click the Tips icon for instructions on how to file the claim.\n\nYou can track your claims on your Highmark portal, or call Highmark Member Services with any claim related questions: 800-241-5704.\n\nIf you have the SHIP, prescription drugs are covered, with a copay, at in-network pharmacies. However, prescription drug costs vary according to the drug type (generic, brand-name and specialty), and their corresponding tier levels (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.). Lower tiers (generic) usually have lower copays, while higher tiers (brand-name and specialty) have higher copays.\n\nEnrollments and waivers do not carry over from one academic year to the next; completing Open Enrollment is an annual requirement. Students must enroll in, or waive, the CMU SHIP every academic year that they are enrolled at the university.\n\nAt the start of each academic year, all full-time students (and some part-time students) enrolled in a degree-seeking program are assessed a placeholder charge for the CMU Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). This placeholder charge remains on a student's account until they complete Open Enrollment.\n\nIf you do not complete Open Enrollment, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU Medical SHIP and the insurance fee will remain on your student account.\n\nIf you receive an approved waiver, the insurance fee will be credited back to your student account.\n\nPlease note that invoices are generated on the first day of each month. Please check the Account Activity page in SIO for up-to-date charges and credits.\n\nStudent account or invoice questions should be directed to Student Financial Services.\n\nNo, the insurance fee posted on a student's account is a placeholder charge, and paying the insurance fee does not complete your SHIP enrollment.\n\nStudents must submit a SHIP enrollment during their Open Enrollment period:\n\nInsurance ID cards should arrive 2-3 weeks after your enrollment has been processed. If you are need of your member ID number before your card arrives:\n\nA U.S. mailing address is required to enroll in the CMU SHIP. Enrollments submitted with a non-U.S. address, or an incomplete address, will not be processed.\n\nInternational students enrolling in the CMU SHIP should wait until they have secured a U.S. mailing address where they can receive mail before submitting an enrollment. Waiting until later in the Open Enrollment period to enroll in the SHIP will not affect the coverage dates. SHIP coverage begins on August 1 each academic year, even if you do not submit your enrollment until the end of the Open Enrollment period.\n\nThe CMU SHIP is a full year plan with a coverage period of August 1 - July 31 each academic year. Students entering CMU in the Fall are enrolled and charged for the full coverage year.\n\nStudents graduating in December can request to cancel the SHIP at that time; it does not cancel automatically. Students with an approved cancellation will receive a prorated refund of the remaining months' premiums on the medical, dental and/or vision plans (with adjustment for any PhD student insurance support, if applicable). SHIP cancellations are effective from the first of the month following the month in which the cancellation form is received.\n\nThe final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31, for an April 1 cancellation.  May, June and July cancellations are not permitted.\n\nIf you are graduating in December and would like to cancel your insurance plan, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.\n\nCancellations are only available under the following circumstances:\n\nDecember Graduation (or September certification for doctoral students graduating in December)\n\nFormal separation from CMU (i.e. leave of absence, withdrawal, suspension, forfeit)\n\nFall semester foreign exchange students returning to their university after the fall semester\n\nEnrollment in Medicaid in the state in which you are studying (e.g., a Pittsburgh campus student approved for enrollment into PA Medicaid). Enrollment is based on eligibility and the application process can be lengthy. Students must also have applied for Medicaid before or during their open enrollment period. Locate PA state information.\n\nThe option to join a new plan does not make a student eligible to cancel their current insurance enrollment.\n\nIf you meet this criterion, email UHS when your university enrollment status has been updated to reflect one of the statuses listed above (or when you wish to remove a dependent or have been approved for Medicaid) and we can assist you. You may be eligible to receive a pro-rated refund for the remaining months' premiums.\n\nThe final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31 and the insurance plan cannot be canceled after April 1 (May, June and July cancellations are not permitted).\n\nYou can only enroll in the SHIP outside of your Open Enrollment period if you have had a qualifying life event (for example, involuntary loss of insurance, including due to turning age 26). This applies to the student medical, dental and vision plans; you cannot add the dental or vision plan outside of Open Enrollment without a qualifying event.\n\nIf you are already enrolled in a SHIP plan, you can add dependents who have had a qualifying life event (for example, birth/adoption of a child or arrival to the U.S. for the first time during the coverage year).\n\nYou have 90 days from the qualifying life event into enroll in the SHIP medical, dental or vision plan. You will also need to provide supporting documentation .\n\nRemoving Dependents:\n\nDependents can be removed from your insurance plan at any time before March 31 of the coverage year.\n\nTo make any of these changes, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.\n\nThe CMU SHIP is a national plan, with participating in-network providers in every state.

Talking to someone can help decrease the intensity of your feelings in the moment and they can help you formulate a plan to be safe.\n\nAll feelings move through us in waves – they come and go. Please remember that you might be feeling very different in a few hours or days. If you struggle with thoughts of suicide regularly and feel nothing will help, please remember that it is always possible to find a way through our most painful feelings.\n\nTry to distance yourself from your suicidal thoughts in the moment by turning to positive, nourishing activities. Any activity can help. Talking to someone you trust, taking a walk, writing/journaling, playing video games, praying or being spiritual, meditating. Working to make sense of and address the suicidal feelings and thoughts should happen at a time when you are feeling safe.\n\nRemove any objects in your environment that can harm you – ask someone you trust to help.\n\nRefrain from alcohol and drug use.\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) \n                        Highmark Center for Health, Wellness & Athletics, 4th Floor\n100 Tech Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nMorewood Gardens\n1060 Morewood Avenue, 2nd Floor \nPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2922\n\n• Suicide Prevention Resource Center\n• Know the Signs\n• The Campaign to Change Direction\n\n• Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation\n• Career & Professional Development Center\n• Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion\n• Civility Initiatives\n• Cohon University Center\n• Community Health & Well-Being\n\n• Community Responsiblity\n• Conference & Event Services\n• Counseling & Psychological Services\n• Dean of Students\n• Dining Services\n• Family Engagement\n• First-Year Orientation\n• Fraternity & Sorority Life\n\n• Housing Services\n• Pre-College Programs\n• Residential Education\n• Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\n• Student Support Resources\n• University Health Services\n• Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Professional Training\n\n• Legal Info\n• www.cmu.edu\n\n• Â© 2025 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n• CMU on Instagram\n\n• Get Support\n    \n\n                      Support For Yourself\n    \n\n                      For Someone Else\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n• Services\n    \n\n                      Gender Affirming Care\n    \n\n                      Let's Talk\n    \n\n                      Consultation\n    \n\n                      Groups & Skills Clinics\n    \n\n                      Individual Therapy\n    \n\n                      Outreach Prevention & Education\n    \n\n                      Psychiatric Care\n    \n\n                      Referrals\n    \n\n                      Tele-Mental Health\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n• TimelyCare\n• Resources\n• Professional Training\n• Get Involved\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n    \n\n                      Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n• Contact CaPS\n• About CaPS\n    \n\n                      Frequently Asked Questions\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• CaPS Event D-List Sign Up\n\n• Support For Yourself\n• For Someone Else\n\n• Gender Affirming Care\n• Let's Talk\n• Consultation\n• Groups & Skills Clinics\n• Individual Therapy\n• Outreach Prevention & Education\n• Psychiatric Care\n• Referrals\n• Tele-Mental Health\n\n• Inclusion & Mental Health\n\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n[CONTACT INFO]\nPhone: 877-565-8860\nPhone: 412-268-2922\nPhone: 888-796-8226\nPhone: 800-273-8255\nPhone: 866-488-7386",

UHS offers guidance on what to look for and how to treat your symptoms.\n\nCall UHS for the following:\n\nFor more information about COVID19 care at UHS visit our services and fees page.\n\nThe flu vaccine is available to students at UHS and covered by the student health insurance plan (SHIP). See our services and fees page for cost without SHIP. If you do not have the SHIP, check with your insurance company to see if the vaccine is covered.\n\nVaccination appointments can be scheduled online via HealthConnect, appointments available daily.\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFLUENZA (FLU) AND COVID-19?\n\nSick with the flu? Know what to do!\n\nInfluenza (or flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by flu viruses. Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs. If you get flu symptoms, in most cases, you should stay home and avoid contact with others except to get medical care.\n\nKnow the Symptoms of Flu\n\nFlu viruses can cause mild to severe illness, and at can lead to death. The flu is different from a cold. The flu usually come on suddenly.\n\nPeople who have the flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: fever* or feeling feverish/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue (tiredness). Some people have vomiting and diarrhea, which is more common in children.\n\n*It's important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever.\n\nTake antiviral drugs if your doctor prescribes them.\n\nAntiviral drugs can be used to treat flu illness. Antiviral drugs can make illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu complications.\n\nCDC recommends that antiviral drugs be used early to treat people who are very sick with the flu and people who get flu symptoms who are at high risk of serious flu complications, either because of their age or because they have a high risk medical condition.\n\nStay home when sick.\n\nWhen you are sick, limit  contact with others as much as possible. Remember to cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when your cough or sneeze, and throw tissues in the trash after you use them. Stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities.\n\nYour fever should be gone for 24 hours without the use of a fever-reducing medicine before resuming normal activities.\n\nSymptom onset\n\nFatigue, weakness\n\nUniversity Health Services\n                                Student Affairs\n                        100 Tech Street, 3rd FloorPittsburgh, PA 15213                 412-268-2157\n\n• Severe symptoms (fever greater than 103 fahrenheit, severe cough, or shortness of breath)\n• Chronic conditions or if you are immunocompromised\n• Symptoms for more than 7 days\n\n• If you have mild cold and flu symptoms (see below) we recommend that you treat your symptoms with over the counter medications and stay home and isolate until you have no fever for 24 hours. The best way to prevent spread of upper respiratory viruses is to avoid unnecessary exposure and wear a high quality mask around others.\n• If you are concerned about COVID-19 and have mild symptoms rapid antigen tests are available over the counter.

Recognized for its world-class arts and technology programs, collaboration across disciplines, and innovative leadership of education in the fields of Business Administration, Computer Science, Engineering, Fine Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, Public Policy & Information Systems, and Science, Carnegie Mellon is consistently ranked among the top 25 universities in the United States.\n\nThe Carnegie Mellon University Counseling and Psychological Services Center (CaPS) operates within the Division of Student Affairs (DoSA) in a university setting which offers significant support for students beyond that of the counseling center.  Collaborating with the greater university community affords a trainee exposure to the multidisciplinary aspects of working in a university counseling center.   CaPS provides comprehensive psychological services to the campus community; both graduate and undergraduate students receive services through CaPS. While direct clinical service is a significant focus of CaPS, the center also provides other services to the university community including consultation and outreach programming.\n\nTraining Program Philosophy and Training Opportunities\n\nThe program for doctoral psychology practicum training and psychiatric psychotherapy rotation starts in mid-August 2024 and ends in mid-May 2025. Central to the program’s value is a social justice aspiration that strives to integrate inclusion and belonging practices. The program is an opportunity to build upon developing psychotherapeutic skills via supportive reflection on clinical, personal, and professional development.  Our training model emphasizes 1) attending to and supporting the trainee’s developmental needs; 2) beginning the development of one’s professional and personal identity and self-awareness; and 3) integrating practice and clinical theory. The training program is developmental in nature and attentive to the individual needs of trainees with varying levels and breadth of knowledge and expertise.  Training experiences build gradually throughout the year and are based upon the trainee’s readiness as gauged by their supervisor and the Practicum Program Coordinator.\n\nThe practicum experience at CMU CaPS centers on experiential training in the provision of individual therapy with the opportunity to engage in group therapy.  Individual psychotherapy is the major focus of the practicum training at CaPS. CaPS clinical and training philosophy is grounded in developmentally informed depth-oriented therapy by understanding people in context. Supervisors’ orientations vary, including psychodynamic, relational-cultural, humanistic/existential, and third-wave CBT. CMU CaPS offers a brief treatment model, which can vary depending on the clinical needs of the client. Typically, students are seen for about a semester. Trainees may have the option to carry longer-term clients based on clinical needs and upon consultation with their individual supervisor.\n\nThis program requires a minimum of 16 total hours per week, consisting of the following training activities: 9-10 hours of direct service, 1-2 hours of supervision (1 hour by CaPS staff with an additional hour of supervision by a doctoral psychology intern in the spring semester), 3 hours of seminars and didactic training, and 1-2 hours of paperwork. Seminars and didactic training activities take place Thursday mornings from 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. and in-person attendance is mandatory.
