CuRB helps participants practice strategies, skills and tools to be an active bystander",
  "main_content": "Culturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB) at CMU\nCMU community members were introduced to the concept of bystander intervention to disrupt power-based personal violence (dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking) through\nGreen Dot\ntraining from 2018-2023. Building on that foundation, the CuRB curriculum was developed in response to a need for evolving our existing bystander intervention program to be more responsive to how power, bias, and privilege impact our ability to support others. After holding pilot sessions with students, staff and faculty throughout 2023, CuRB is now live and available to the CMU community for those interested in bystander intervention training.\nThe CuRB training covers how identity, power, and privilege impacts our role as bystanders and provides space to explore how we arrive at our understandings and perceptions of others. This focus on group reflection and discussion sets the stage for collaboratively unlearning harmful biases that might negatively impact our ability to help loved ones or community members experiencing power-based personal violence. Through open discussion, scenario exercises and actionable tools, CuRB empowers participants to intercept different forms of harm and provide culturally responsive and person-centered support.",

We can come to your student group, department, or residence hall! For groups of 10 or more, we can accommodate special requests for virtual and in-person programs.\nRequest a CuRB program.\nCuRB Training Options\nThere are two CuRB training options: one\nfull length 5 hour session\nand another\n1.5 hour session\n. Each version of CuRB centers identity and power and provides opportunity for participants to practice skills. Although both trainings offer opportunities for participants to practice, share with the group and engage with the material, the full length training features more space for discussion and scenario practice. While the 1.5 hour session doesn't offer as much room for open discussion, participants still have the opportunity to share their thoughts with others and practice key skills.\nWondering which session is the right one for your group?
