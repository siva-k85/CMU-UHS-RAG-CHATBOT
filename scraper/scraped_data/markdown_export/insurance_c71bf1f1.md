Student Medical Insurance Mandate
Health insurance is vital
to ensuring access to care and predictable health care costs, as well as aiding students in the achievement of their personal and academic goals.
That is why a
ll full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. are required to meet CMU's
health insurance mandate
each academic year.
To fulfill this mandate students must have insurance that meets
university requirements
for the duration of their time as an enrolled student, either through
enrolling in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), or
obtaining a SHIP waiver
:
The enroll/waive process must be completed during a student's
Open Enrollment
period.
SHIP enrollments and waivers do not roll over from one academic year to the next.
If you do not have insurance that meets university requirements you must
enroll in the medical SHIP
.
By default, a SHIP
placeholder charge
is posted to your student account, until you complete Open Enrollment.
If you do not complete
Open Enrollment
you will be
auto-enrolled
in the medical SHIP.Â  Auto enrollments are not recommended, and beginning in Fall 25 will incur a $50 processing fee.
