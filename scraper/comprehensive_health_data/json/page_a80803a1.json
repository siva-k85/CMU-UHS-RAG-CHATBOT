Check out the\nApril 2025 edition [PDF].\nMeet the Wellness & Meaning-Making Programs Team\nThe process of clarifying our values and developing our understanding of our life’s meaning in the world is an essential part of one’s spiritual life and growth. In common usage, we often assume that spirituality language is reserved for a person’s commitment to, participation in, or struggle with established religious organizations and practices.\nHowever, in the last 20 years, researchers from a national study on\nSpirituality and Higher Education\nconducted by the Higher Education Research Institute in California articulated that spirituality includes development of:\nAn active search for meaning, purpose, and/or wisdom;\nA global worldview open to engagement across spiritual traditions, appreciating a sense of connection across humanity and seeking to understand and charitably interpret others’ cultural and spiritual experiences;\nPersonal value of relational virtues like compassion, kindness, generosity, and forgiveness;\nAn ethic of care for the welfare of others and the world;\nParticipation in constructive or charitable practices which may involve helping friends, neighbors, and the broader community with time, relationship, and resources.\nExplore how we live into these wellness and meaning-making commitments at\nWellness Initiatives\nand\nReligious and Spiritual Life\n.\nMeet the Team\nHarsh Agarwal\nProgram Specialist for Wellness Initiatives\nHighmark Center for Health, Wellness and Athletics\nSuite 114\n615-955-9163\n|\nEmail Harsh\nHarsh (he/him) joined CMU as a Program Specialist for the Wellness Initiatives in September 2023.
