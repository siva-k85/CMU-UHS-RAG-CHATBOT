      <paragraph>Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) supports inclusion in mental health. CaPS strives to promote and support inclusion and justice within CaPS and the CMU community. Our goal is to construct mechanisms that foster and empower individual, collective and systemic accountability within CaPS, in the context of equity and social justice.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Read our statement below.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Our commitment to providing support extends beyond clinical practice and into our interactions with colleagues, campus partners, and the broader community. We are aware of the challenges many students face in their daily lives and the emotional toll they may carry. We are here to support you in navigating these challenges, offering comfort and assistance as needed. To our students especially, CaPS is here to support you.CaPS understands that statements of support are only a part of the process. We are dedicated to being active participants in meaningful progress, not simply offering words of solidarity. We are committed to providing care to all students who are impacted by adversity and hardship. We are also committed to facilitating conversations within our Tartan community that promote awareness and create an environment where every individual feels safe and supported</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Inclusion &amp; Mental Health Goal: CaPS aims at creating an environment where all students feel valued and understood.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>While the resources provided below are identity-based, we recognize that the intersectionality of identity is nuanced and multidimensional, and that you will find yourself represented in more than one category.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Ideally, therapy is a place where one can feel safe and understood. Working with a culturally responsive counselor can be truly beneficial and healing.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Many therapists have received some form of cultural competency education in their training and educational journeys but it is often limited in scope and practice. A culturally sensitive therapist pays attention to the client’s and their own identities, social and cultural backgrounds, and past and current socio-political events to guide the treatment and relationship.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>This is not an exhaustive list of questions that a culturally sensitive therapist should be able to address with their clients, it is a good place to start.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Intersectionality, as coined by scholar and writer Kimberlé Crenshaw, is a lens through which we seek to understand how multiple forms of oppression/inequality may combine to create unique obstacles and trauma.</paragraph>

        <item>Most importantly, ask questions. While this might feel uncomfortable given the professional nature of the relationship, you must feel comfortable with your therapist.
