The bill from the medical provider will show the charges for the treatment, what your insurance plan has paid and what you owe.\nTo start, it is helpful to review the SHIP's\nMedical Plan Coverage Table\n, as well as some\ncommon insurance terms\n, in order to better understand what services are covered under the plan.  It is also important to register with\nHighmark\nwhere you can track your medical claims and access your\nExplanations of Benefits\n(EOB). The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.\nUniversity Health Services (UHS) Charges:\nIf you are enrolled in the SHIP and receive care at University Health Services (UHS), many of the\nfees for our services\nwill be covered by the plan.  If you do owe any fees, those charges will be posted to your student account.\nFor questions about a UHS charge\nemail the student health insurance team\n.\nBills from off-campus providers:\nIf you see a provider or have a hospital visit outside of UHS, you may receive a bill for non-covered services, and/or copays:\nIf the bill indicates little/no insurance was applied to the claim (often noted as an\n\"\nUninsured\nDiscount\")\n, please contact the medical provider directly, give them your insurance information and ask that they re-submit the claim to the SHIP.\nIf you saw a provider at UPMC, you can register with UPMC to track claims and bills.\nIf you recieved a bill for medical services, refer to the\nMedical Plan Coverage Table\nto verify coverage and copay amounts.\nIf you received a bill for dental or vision services, refer to the\ndental and vision plan books\nfor coverage and copay amounts.\nIf you still have questions about SHIP coverage, please call the Member Services phone number on the back of your insurance ID card.  Member Services will be able to look at your claims, and verify coverage based on the diagnosis and procedure codes provided with the claim.\nLaboratory Testing:\nBasic diagnostic testing is covered by the SHIP at in-network labs, but students will owe a $25 copay for the date of service.\nIf a test is not fully covered by the SHIP, students will recieve a bill from the laboratory for that amount.\nBills are sent to the address listed on your SHIP enrollment.\nStudents can find information on lab claims by accessing their\nExplanations of Benefits\n(EOB) in their Highmark portal. The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.\nBloodwork done at UHS is sent to Quest Diagnostics for processing:\nto track claims, pay a bill, or for any questions regarding bills register with\nQuest Diagnostics\nand/or call Quest Member Services.\nBills for Ambulance Transport:\nThe SHIP covers the cost of emergency ambulance transports, however students are responsible for paying the transport company directly. Highmark will mail you a check for the amount of the transport, once it arrives you have two options:\nYou can cash the check and pay the company directly, as per the payment instructions on the bill or;\nYou\ncan endorse the Highmark check over to the transport company:\non the back of the check there is an endorsement line - you would write:\npay to the order of\n(name of the company on the bill), and sign your name.\nmail the check to the address listed on the bill.\nBe sure to keep a copy of the bill and check for your records.\nIf you receive a medical bill and still need assistance, please message the Student Health Insurance Team through\nHealthConnect\n, and include a copy of your bill and Explanation of Benefits, if available.\nDoes the CMU SHIP cover wisdom tooth extractions?\nWisdom teeth (third molar) removal is covered under the SHIP Dental Plan and Medical Plan. However, coverage will depend on whether your teeth are soft tissue impacted, or bony impacted.\nDental Plan Coverage:\nThe SHIP Dental Plan provides benefits for both bony impacted, and soft tissue impacted, wisdom teeth:\nsoft tissue impacted wisdom tooth removal is covered at 80% when using an\nin-network\nprovider in the dental plan, and 70% when using an\nout-of-network\nprovider.\npartial and fully bony impacted wisdom tooth removal is covered at 50% with an in-network or out-of-network provider.\nYou can review the coverage for third molar removal on the\nsummary of benefits and coverage,\nlocated on page 27 of the\ndental plan book\n.\nMedical Plan Coverage:\nThe SHIP Medical Plan\nonly\nprovides benefits for impacted wisdom teeth when partially or totally covered by bone:\nbony impacted wisdom tooth removal is covered at 100% when using an in-network provider (Oral Surgeon) in the medical plan.\nYou can review the coverage for third molar removal on page 26 of the\nmedical plan book\n.\nEvaluations & Procedures\nBefore having your wisdom teeth removed, you will need to be evaluated. If you have both the SHIP dental plan and medical plan you can get an evaluation from a dentist, or oral surgeon.\nPrior to making an appointment, verify the provider\nparticipates in the SHIP network\n:\nif you see a dentist, the provider should be in-network on the dental plan.\nif you see an oral surgeon, the provider should be in-network for\nboth\nthe dental and medical plan.\nThe dentist or oral surgeon will determine whether the teeth are soft impacted, or bony impacted.\nIf you see a dentist, and they determine you need to have your wisdom teeth removed, you will then need to make an appointment with an oral surgeon for a consultation.\nAt your evaluation you will want to ask for a\npre-determination\nto verify coverage and costs.  If you have both the medical and dental plan, the two plans will coordinate your coverage, if necessary.\nThe provider will let you know once that pre-determination has been finalized, and you will be able to see how much of the procedure is covered, and if you will have any out-of-pocket cost. You can then make an appointment for the procedure, if desired.\nOnce the procedure is complete, the provider will submit a claim to the SHIP. If you have any out-of-pocket costs you will have to pay at the time of service, or you will be sent a bill.\nWhat is Pediatric Dental and Vision Coverage?\nThe CMU Medical SHIP provides dental and vision services for students, and their eligible dependents, under the age of 19.\nThis coverage is seperate from the optional dental and vision plans.\nPediatric Dental Benefits\nStudents under the age of 19 prior to the beginning of the coverage period (August 1) are eligible for Pediatric Dental benefits on the Medical Plan:\nBenefits are for the full coverage year (August 1 - July 31).\nBenefits include routine exams, X-rays, cleanings, consultations, palliative treatment (emergency), sealants and space maintainers, when using an in-network provider.\nReview Pediatric Dental benefits on page 11 of the\nMedical Plan Book\n.\nReview SHIP Dental Plan benefits on page 27 of the\nDental Plan Book\n.\nPediatric Vision Benefits\nStudents under the age of 19 prior to the beginning of the coverage period (August 1) are eligible for Pediatric Dental benefits on the Medical Plan:\nBenefits are only available until the end of the month the student, or dependent, turns 19.\nBenefits include exams, frames and lenses, when using an in-network provider.\nReview Pediatric Vision benefits on page 28 of the\nMedical Plan Book\n.\nReview SHIP Vision Plan benefits on page 7 of the\nVision Plan Book\n.\nHow do I submit a claim for reimbursement?\nClaim f\norms can be found in the\nHighmark forms library\n.\nOnce you have selected the proper form, click the\nTips\nicon for instructions on how to file the claim.\nMedical Claims: Use the\nMember Submitted Health Insurance Claim Form\n.\nDental Claims: Use the\nMember Dental Claim Form\n.\nPlease note the Highmark site currently reflects the option to submit claims online, but there are no online submissions for dental claims at this time.\nVision Claims: Use the\nDirect Reimbursement Claim Form\n.\nPrescription Claims: Use the\nPrescription Drug Reimbursement Form or Specialty Drugs Form\n.\nYou can track your claims on your Highmark portal, or call Highmark Member Services with any claim related questions: 800-241-5704.\nWhere can I find information on prescription medication coverage and costs?\nIf you have the SHIP, prescription drugs are covered, with a\ncopay\n,\nat in-network pharmacies. However, p\nrescription drug costs vary according to the drug type (generic, brand-name and specialty), and their corresponding tier levels (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.). Lower tiers (generic) usually have lower copays, while higher tiers (brand-name and specialty) have higher copays.\nReview how to\nsearch for covered medications\nand corresponding copays.\nIf prescribed a higher tiered medication, speak to your provider, or pharmacist, about the possiblity of receiveing the less costly generic version, if available.\nSome medications can be dispensed from UHS when you see a UHS provider.\nEach medication dispensed can incur up to a $15 copay.\nOver-the-counter medicine and supplies (not prescribed) are not covered by the SHIP when purchased at a retail store (example: CVS).\nStudent Health Insurance Requirement and SHIP fees\nDoes my insurance enrollment or waiver carry over each year or do I need to re-apply?\nEnrollments and waivers do not carry over from one academic year to the next; completing\nOpen Enrollment\nis an annual requirement.\nStudents must\nenroll in, or waive, the CMU SHIP every academic year that they are enrolled at the university.\nThere is a charge for insurance on my student account, but I did not enroll in the CMU SHIP.\nAt the start of each academic year, all full-time students (and some part-time students) enrolled in a degree-seeking program are\nassessed a placeholder charge\nfor the CMU Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). This placeholder charge remains on a student's account until they complete\nOpen Enrollment\n.\nIf you do not complete Open Enrollment, you will be\nauto-enrolled\nin the CMU Medical SHIP and the insurance fee will remain on your student account.\nIf you receive an\napproved waiver\n, the insurance fee will be credited back to your student account.\nPlease note that invoices are generated on the first day of each month.\nPlease check the\nAccount Activity\npage in\nSIO\nfor up-to-date charges and credits.\nStudent account or invoice questions should be directed to\nStudent Financial Services\n.\nI paid the insurance fee in my student account. Am I enrolled in the SHIP?\nNo, the insurance fee posted on a student's account is a\nplaceholder charge\n, and paying the insurance fee does not complete your SHIP enrollment.\nStudents must submit a SHIP enrollment during their Open Enrollment period:\nLog into\nSIO\n>\nCampus Life >Health Insurance.\nClick the enroll/waive link to access the portal.\nFollow the instructions to enroll.\nClick 'CONFIRM' to submit your enrollment.\nAdditional Common Questions\nI need my insurance ID card. Where can I find my insurance information?\nInsurance ID cards should arrive 2-3 weeks after your enrollment has been processed.\nIf you are need of your member ID number before your card arrives:\nDuring Open Enrollment, use the portal link in your SHIP enrollment confirmation email (from cmuship@hubinternational) to view your insurance member ID number.  This is not your actual member ID card.\nUse your member ID number to register with\nHighmark\n, and download a digital card until your physical card arrives.\nplease note\nthat the enrollment/waiver portal is only available during Open Enrollment.

Enrollments submitted with a non-U.S. address, or an incomplete address, will not be processed.\nInternational students\nenrolling in the CMU SHIP should wait until they have secured a U.S. mailing address where they can receive mail before submitting an enrollment. Waiting until later in the\nOpen Enrollment\nperiod to enroll in the SHIP will not affect the coverage dates. SHIP coverage begins on August 1 each academic year, even if you do not submit your enrollment until the end of the Open Enrollment period.\nW\nhen submitting an address, please include the apartment/room number, if applicable, or your member ID will not be delivered.\nIf I am graduating in December, can I enroll in the SHIP for August - December only?  Can I enroll only for the months I am on campus?\nThe CMU SHIP is a full year plan with a coverage period of August 1 - July 31 each academic year. Students entering CMU in the Fall are enrolled and charged for the full coverage year.\nStudents graduating in December can request to cancel the SHIP at that time; it does not cancel automatically. Students with an approved cancellation will receive a prorated refund of the remaining months' premiums on the medical, dental and/or vision plans (with adjustment for any PhD student insurance support, if applicable).\nSHIP cancellations are effective from the first of the month following the month in which the cancellation form is received.\nThe final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31, for an April 1 cancellation.  May, June and July cancellations are not permitted.\nIf you are graduating in December and would like to cancel your insurance plan, please email\nshinsure@andrew.cmu.edu\nfor assistance.\nI no longer want my student insurance plan/s.

Enrollment is based on eligibility and the application process can be lengthy.

You may be eligible to receive a pro-rated refund for the remaining months' premiums.\nThe final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31 and the insurance plan cannot be canceled after April 1 (May, June and July cancellations are not permitted).\nOutside of Open Enrollment, can I enroll in the medical, dental or vision plans?
