      <paragraph>With COPE, CaPS engages the CMU community through holistic and inclusive trainings that increase access to services, reduce barriers and help eliminate the stigma around seeking help.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>COPE's philosophy around community engagement is grounded in a culturally inclusive approach that allows us to assess and create programming around the unique needs of the campus community. Together we can facilitate an understanding of self, others and the community around us.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Originally designed by Syracuse University, specifically for a college/university community, Pathways for Suicide Prevention Training is an experiential training focused on enhancing a person’s knowledge, awareness, and skills concerning college student suicide.

You will also learn how to connect them to the appropriate support.  This training is offered in collaboration with Health Promotions and Student Support Resources.</paragraph>

      <paragraph>This is a 90-minute faculty-designed, professional development opportunity that is meant to serve as a broad overview of how best to aid students at Carnegie Mellon University. Following this session, faculty should be able to (1) articulate key findings about the CMU student mental health experience, (2) describe the vital role of faculty in supporting students, (3) identify the appropriate methods to assist students, and (4) describe the available support resources on campus.</paragraph>
