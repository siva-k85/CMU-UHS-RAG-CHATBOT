  "main_content": "Leaving CMU?\nBefore you embark on your next journey, make sure that you review this page thoroughly to learn more about access to services, your insurance plan and requesting your medical records.\nGraduating Students\nIf you graduate in May, you can be seen at Health Services for two weeks following your graduation date. If you graduate in December, you can be seen at Health Services up until our winter holiday closure.\nIf you are in Pittsburgh after that time and need services, we can help you find\nlocal providers\nfor your health care needs.\nIf you are enrolled in the CMU student health insurance plan:\nYou have that coverage until July 31. This is a national plan and can be used in any state at any facility that accepts the insurance plan.\nIf you have an offer for employer-sponsored medical insurance, you are not required to cancel the CMU student medical insurance plan. You have the option to tell your employer that you have medical insurance in effect through July 31. The employer can then help you enroll in their plan effective August 1 because you would then have a loss of coverage (which is considered a qualifying life event for enrollment into a medical insurance plan outside of that plan's Open Enrollment period).\nWe strongly recommend comparing the student insurance plan with the one being offered by the employer. Pay close attention to not only the premiums, but deductible of the plans, co-pays, co-insurance, and the list of benefits offered.\nRequest Your Medical Records\nImmunization records, test results, statements and after-visit summaries are all available to download/print from HealthConnect. Current students and recent graduates (within 90 days) can request additional medical records by using \"Messages\" in\nHEALTHCONNECT.\nFormer students who no longer have access to HealthConnect must submit a\nConsent for Release of Medical Information Form (pdf).\nPlease note that UHS maintains patient records for 10 years; we are unable to provide records beyond 10 years.\nStudents who received care at Counseling & Psychological Services (CaPS) must contact CaPS directly to request mental health records, at 412-268-2922.",
