MPV
WHO has declared
MPV a global health emergency
. (MPV was previously referred to as Monkeypox.)
University Health Services (UHS) providers and staff have been trained to identify and test for MPV and to provide referrals for vaccination and treatment should positive cases impact our community. Contact tracing is conducted by Allegheny County Health Department staff who will coordinate with the university to provide support to impacted students.
MPV is transmitted through close skin-to-skin contact with an infected person (kissing, cuddling, sex). Symptoms of MPV include rash, spots, ulcers, blister-like lesions anywhere on the body but especially in the genital area, swollen/painful lymph nodes, fever, headache, muscle aches, chills and exhaustion.
If you experience any of these symptoms, call UHS at
412-268-2157
or go to your local urgent care.
