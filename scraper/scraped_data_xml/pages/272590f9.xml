      <paragraph>Carnegie Mellon University supports The National Institute for Health’s definition of wellness as an active process of becoming aware of, and making choices toward, a healthy and fulfilling life. It’s a conscious, self-directed and evolving process, meaning you will always be working to create a fulfilling life. It involves identifying and living out our values in everyday practice, while being connected to a supportive community. The absence of illness or disease does not confirm our wellness, nor does any singular milestone or success. In addition, well-being also means holding what’s happening in our broader culture and recognizing the impact and implications it has on us and our community. We cannot be well when our community is not well.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Holistic well-being as a state is similar to our learning; we are never finished and there are always new ways to grow, to understand, and to change.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The process of clarifying our values and developing our understanding of our life’s meaning in the world is an essential part of one’s spiritual life and growth. In common usage, we often assume that spirituality language is reserved for a person’s commitment to, participation in, or struggle with established religious organizations and practices.</paragraph>
