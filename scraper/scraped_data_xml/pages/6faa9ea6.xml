Student Instructions for Submission of Application for Medical Exemption from Vaccination:
Please have your medical provider complete the Healthcare Provider Section and Verification portion of this form, and
submit the completed form to health@andrew.cmu.edu or fax to 412-268-6357. Information will be kept only in your
confidential electronic health record. Your application will be reviewed, and you will receive a secure message through
HealthConnect notifying you of the decision. If your request is granted, your vaccination compliance record will be
updated. You may check your compliance record to verify your information at https://www.cmu.edu/health-
services/healthconnect/index.html.
Student Section and Attestation:
By signing this application, I am requesting a medical exemption from vaccination for one or more of the following
immunizations required by Carnegie Mellon University (“CMU”) for incoming and/or current students:
_____ Meningococcal ACWY (required only for students living on campus)
_____ MMR- Measles, Mumps, and Rubella
_____ Varicella
_____ COVID-19
By signing this application, I attest that:
 I have reviewed the information on the risks associated with these diseases provided by CMU on its University
Health Services website at https://www.cmu.edu/health-services/new-students/index.html#immunizations.
 I have been informed that I may be placing myself and others at risk of serious illness should I contract a disease
that could have been prevented through proper vaccination.
 I understand that a student who has been exempt from a vaccination is still considered susceptible to the
disease(s) for which the vaccine offers protection.
 I understand that, for the safety of the campus community, I will be required to comply with CMU’s infection
control measures, which may include removal from CMU if CMU and/or a local or state public authority advises
removal due to a communicable disease outbreak.
 I understand that, if I am applying for a medical exemption from COVID-19 vaccination, I must comply with
CMU’s COVID-19 mitigation protocols.
