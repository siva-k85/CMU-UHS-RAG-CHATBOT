UHS offers many confidential services to support your sexual health.\nAll straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, transgender, single, partnered and polyamorous individuals should have an annual health exam.\nSexual Health Resources\nBedsider\nPlanned Parenthood\nGo Ask Alice!\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)\nPittsburgh Action Against Rape (PAAR)\nCMU's Office of Title IX Initiatives\nGynecological Exam\nSexually active individuals 21 years of age or older with female reproductive organs should also have an annual\ngynecological exam. Gynecology is health care for the female reproductive system.\nWhat is a pelvic exam?\nA pelvic exam is a normal and important part of taking care of your body. During a pelvic exam, a health care provider checks your pelvic area for problems. There are usually three parts to the exam:\nThe Visual Exam - Your health care provider will look at your\nvulva\nand the opening of your vagina.\nThe Speculum Exam - Your provider will gently insert a speculum into your vagina. A speculum is a metal or plastic tool that separates the walls of the vagina when it opens. This may feel uncomfortable but not painful. Let your provider know if it is.\nYour provider will determine if you should have a Pap test done. During a Pap test, the provider takes a small sample of cells from your cervix for the Pap test. At this time, a sample may also be taken to test for sexually transmitted infections.\nThe Bimanual Exam - Your provider will insert one or two gloved fingers into your vagina while gently pressing on your lower abdomen with the other hand. This is a way to check your uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.\nWhat is a Pap test?\nThis is a test that can find signs that cervical cancer may develop. Providers use a tiny brush or spatula to collect a small sample of cells from your cervix (the lower part of your uterus). The cells are sent to a laboratory to be examined. The Pap test is a painless procedure that takes less than a minute and is one part of a gynecological exam.\nHow long does a gynecological exam last?\nGynecological visits take about one hour. Extra time is needed to complete paperwork, prepare you for the exam and answer your questions. Your health care provider will talk with you for 10-15 minutes and the exam itself takes 10-15 minutes, including a five-minute pelvic exam.\nIs the exam painful?\nNo. You may feel some pressure but you should not feel pain. If you feel pain, tell the health care provider.\nHow do I prepare for an exam?\nPlan your pelvic exam for a day you when you will not have your period.\nDo not have vaginal intercourse or insert anything into your vagina for a day or two before your visit.\nWomen should not douche. But if you do, do not douche or use any other vaginal products for at least 24 hours before your visit.\nMake a list of the questions you want to ask and be prepared to discuss your gynecological and sexual health history.\nGynecological Exams May Include:\nTalking about your medical history\nGeneral physical exam\nBreast and\npelvic exam\nor testicular exam\nTesting for\nsexually transmitted infections\n(STIs)\nVaccinations\nTalking about safer sex,\nbirth control, and\nhealthy relationships\nPregnancy & Birth Control\nWhether you want to prevent pregnancy, consider pregnancy, or learn about what options you have for an unplanned pregnancy, UHS is here to help\n.\nPreventing Pregnancy\nUHS offers many safe and effective birth control methods, including Kyleena, Mirena, and Paragard intrauterine devices (IUDs), Nexplanon implant, birth control pills, patches, vaginal ring, and Depo-provera shot,  We recommend learning about all of your options.
