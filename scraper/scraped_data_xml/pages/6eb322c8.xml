another state for their investigation of those services.
We will disclose your health information potentially related to reproductive health care to
certain health authorities, law enforcement, coroners or medical examiners, or in lawsuits

Some state and other federal laws may restrict our use and disclosure of certain sensitive
health information, such as substance use disorder information, sexually transmitted
diseases, HIV/AIDS, mental health, and genetic information. We will follow the more
stringent or protective law, where it applies. For example, with regard to substance use
disorder records from a federally-assisted substance use disorder program, we will not use
or disclose such records in legal proceedings against the individual who is the subject of
those records without written consent or a court order after notice and an opportunity to be
heard is provided.

NOTE REGARDING STUDENT MEDICAL RECORDS &amp; FERPA The privacy practices set forth
above do not apply to medical records of students at Carnegie Mellon. Medical records of
students maintained by UHS are governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
of 1974 (FERPA) and the University’s policy on the Privacy Rights of Students. Under FERPA,

disclosed to individuals providing treatment. Treatment records may be disclosed:
o To health care professionals who are providing treatment to the student, including
health care professionals who are not part of or not acting on behalf of Carnegie Mellon
(e.g. a third-party health care provider), as long as the treatment records are disclosed for
the purpose of treatment.
o To a third-party health care provider when the student has requested that his or
her records be reviewed by a physician or other appropriate professional of the student’s
\\4163-1993-2503 v1 W:\Admin\Governance
