    <paragraphs>
      <paragraph>Each academic year, students are required to enroll in CMU's student medical insurance plan or obtain a SHIP waiver. Students must take this action during their Open Enrollment period through the insurance portal in Student Information Online (SIO).</paragraph>
      <paragraph>This process is required each academic year. Enrollments and waivers do not carry over from the previous academic year.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>To qualify for a waiver, students must verify that they have active medical insurance that meets university requirements. All insurance plans must be active for the duration of your time as an enrolled student. Students (and families where applicable) are responsible for reviewing these requirements and verifying that their medical insurance meets them.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Waiver applications must be submitted by the student, through the insurance portal in SIO, prior to a student's Open Enrollment deadline. If approved, the student insurance charge will be credited back to the student's account. With an approved waiver, a student accepts full financial liability for any medical costs incurred. If a waiver is not approved (because the plan does not meet university requirements), the student must enroll in the CMU student medical insurance plan.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Late waiver applications will be accepted for two weeks after a student's Open Enrollment deadline, and are subject to a $50 late fee.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Students who have extenuating circumstances and wish to request a waiver beyond the two-week late period must submit a formal appeal. Submitting an appeal does not guarantee that a waiver will be approved, but does allow a student's circumstances to be considered. If an appeal is granted and the waiver is approved, the student will be responsible for paying the student medical plan premium for the months of enrollment. Waiver appeals are not accepted after 90 days from a student's Open Enrollment deadline. Contact the Student Health Insurance Team  for late waiver requests and appeals.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>In order to waive CMU's Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), all full-time students who are physically located in the U.S. must have health insurance that meets the following requirements:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Students must have continuous medical insurance coverage for their duration of time as an enrolled student. The insurance plan must be in force for the academic year/semester (whichever applies) to ensure there is no gap in coverage:</paragraph>
