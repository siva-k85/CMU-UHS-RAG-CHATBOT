UHS promotes and provides primary birth control methods, like birth control pills and IUDs for pregnancy prevention. Emergency contraception (Plan B) is also available at UHS. However, ordering it from UHS or going to a pharmacy may not be feasible for everyone. The UHS Wellness to Go vending machines provide more convenient access to lower cost emergency contraception. Offering other wellness and harm reduction supplies alongside reproductive health items will provide CMU students with many affordable health products when they need them most.\nDivision of Student Affairs\nAthletics, Physical Education & Recreation\nCareer & Professional Development Center\nCenter for Student Diversity & Inclusion\nCivility Initiatives\nCohon University Center\nCommunity Health & Well-Being\nCommunity Responsibility\nConference & Event Services\nCounseling & Psychological Services\nDean of Students\nDining Services\nFamily Engagement\nFirst-Year Orientation\nFraternity & Sorority Life\nHousing Services\nPre-College Programs\nResidential Education\nStudent Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\nStudent Support Resources\nUniversity Health Services\nWellness & Meaning-Making Programs\nUHS Partners\nAccreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\nDisability Resources\nTitle IX Initiatives\nUniversity Police\nUniversity Policies\nUniversity Health Services\nStudent Affairs\n100 Tech Street, 3rd Floor\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n412-268-2157\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n©\n2025\nCarnegie Mellon University\nCMU on Facebook\nCMU on Instagram\nHealthConnect\nNew Students\nFamily & Parents\nStudent Insurance\nEnroll in the SHIP\nWaive the SHIP\nChange or Cancel the SHIP\nSHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\nSHIP Rates & Billing\nUsing the SHIP\nInternational, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\nInsurance Literacy\nContacts & Common Questions\nLeaving CMU\nServices & Fees\nCOVID19\nSexual Assault Resources\nLGBTQIA+ Health\nSexual Health\nAllergy Injections\nHealth Education & Resources\nCulturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\nLocal Healthcare Resources\nPeer Health Advocates\nInformation for PHAs\nRecovery and Harm Reduction\nWellness To Go Machines\nAbout Us\nUHS News\nWho We Are\nLeaving CMU",
