    <paragraphs>
      <paragraph>SHIP enrollment or waiver status:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Questions about SHIP coverage (medical procedures, medication, etc.):</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Questions about insurance fees on your student account:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>To update your name, gender, birthdate or mailing address with Highmark:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Depending on the treatment you received, you may have a copay and/or an amount not covered by the insurance plan. The bill from the medical provider will show the charges for the treatment, what your insurance plan has paid and what you owe.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>To start, it is helpful to review the SHIP's Medical Plan Coverage Table, as well as some common insurance terms, in order to better understand what services are covered under the plan.  It is also important to register with Highmark where you can track your medical claims and access your Explanations of Benefits (EOB). The EOB will show what your insurance plan paid, did not pay, and why.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>University Health Services (UHS) Charges:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you are enrolled in the SHIP and receive care at University Health Services (UHS), many of the fees for our services will be covered by the plan.  If you do owe any fees, those charges will be posted to your student account.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Bills from off-campus providers:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you see a provider or have a hospital visit outside of UHS, you may receive a bill for non-covered services, and/or copays:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Laboratory Testing:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Bills for Ambulance Transport:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The SHIP covers the cost of emergency ambulance transports, however students are responsible for paying the transport company directly. Highmark will mail you a check for the amount of the transport, once it arrives you have two options:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you receive a medical bill and still need assistance, please message the Student Health Insurance Team through HealthConnect, and include a copy of your bill and Explanation of Benefits, if available.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Wisdom teeth (third molar) removal is covered under the SHIP Dental Plan and Medical Plan. However, coverage will depend on whether your teeth are soft tissue impacted, or bony impacted.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Dental Plan Coverage:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The SHIP Dental Plan provides benefits for both bony impacted, and soft tissue impacted, wisdom teeth:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>You can review the coverage for third molar removal on the summary of benefits and coverage, located on page 27 of the dental plan book.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Medical Plan Coverage:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The SHIP Medical Plan only provides benefits for impacted wisdom teeth when partially or totally covered by bone:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>You can review the coverage for third molar removal on page 26 of the medical plan book.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Evaluations &amp; Procedures</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Before having your wisdom teeth removed, you will need to be evaluated. If you have both the SHIP dental plan and medical plan you can get an evaluation from a dentist, or oral surgeon.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The CMU Medical SHIP provides dental and vision services for students, and their eligible dependents, under the age of 19. This coverage is seperate from the optional dental and vision plans.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Pediatric Dental Benefits</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Pediatric Vision Benefits</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Claim forms can be found in the Highmark forms library. Once you have selected the proper form, click the Tips icon for instructions on how to file the claim.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>You can track your claims on your Highmark portal, or call Highmark Member Services with any claim related questions: 800-241-5704.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you have the SHIP, prescription drugs are covered, with a copay, at in-network pharmacies. However, prescription drug costs vary according to the drug type (generic, brand-name and specialty), and their corresponding tier levels (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.). Lower tiers (generic) usually have lower copays, while higher tiers (brand-name and specialty) have higher copays.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Enrollments and waivers do not carry over from one academic year to the next; completing Open Enrollment is an annual requirement. Students must enroll in, or waive, the CMU SHIP every academic year that they are enrolled at the university.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>At the start of each academic year, all full-time students (and some part-time students) enrolled in a degree-seeking program are assessed a placeholder charge for the CMU Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). This placeholder charge remains on a student's account until they complete Open Enrollment.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you do not complete Open Enrollment, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU Medical SHIP and the insurance fee will remain on your student account.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you receive an approved waiver, the insurance fee will be credited back to your student account.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Please note that invoices are generated on the first day of each month. Please check the Account Activity page in SIO for up-to-date charges and credits.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Student account or invoice questions should be directed to Student Financial Services.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>No, the insurance fee posted on a student's account is a placeholder charge, and paying the insurance fee does not complete your SHIP enrollment.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Students must submit a SHIP enrollment during their Open Enrollment period:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Insurance ID cards should arrive 2-3 weeks after your enrollment has been processed. If you are need of your member ID number before your card arrives:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>A U.S. mailing address is required to enroll in the CMU SHIP. Enrollments submitted with a non-U.S. address, or an incomplete address, will not be processed.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>International students enrolling in the CMU SHIP should wait until they have secured a U.S. mailing address where they can receive mail before submitting an enrollment. Waiting until later in the Open Enrollment period to enroll in the SHIP will not affect the coverage dates. SHIP coverage begins on August 1 each academic year, even if you do not submit your enrollment until the end of the Open Enrollment period.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The CMU SHIP is a full year plan with a coverage period of August 1 - July 31 each academic year. Students entering CMU in the Fall are enrolled and charged for the full coverage year.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Students graduating in December can request to cancel the SHIP at that time; it does not cancel automatically. Students with an approved cancellation will receive a prorated refund of the remaining months' premiums on the medical, dental and/or vision plans (with adjustment for any PhD student insurance support, if applicable). SHIP cancellations are effective from the first of the month following the month in which the cancellation form is received.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31, for an April 1 cancellation.  May, June and July cancellations are not permitted.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you are graduating in December and would like to cancel your insurance plan, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Cancellations are only available under the following circumstances:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>December Graduation (or September certification for doctoral students graduating in December)</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Formal separation from CMU (i.e. leave of absence, withdrawal, suspension, forfeit)</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Fall semester foreign exchange students returning to their university after the fall semester</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Enrollment in Medicaid in the state in which you are studying (e.g., a Pittsburgh campus student approved for enrollment into PA Medicaid). Enrollment is based on eligibility and the application process can be lengthy. Students must also have applied for Medicaid before or during their open enrollment period. Locate PA state information.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The option to join a new plan does not make a student eligible to cancel their current insurance enrollment.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you meet this criterion, email UHS when your university enrollment status has been updated to reflect one of the statuses listed above (or when you wish to remove a dependent or have been approved for Medicaid) and we can assist you. You may be eligible to receive a pro-rated refund for the remaining months' premiums.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The final deadline to submit a cancellation request form is March 31 and the insurance plan cannot be canceled after April 1 (May, June and July cancellations are not permitted).</paragraph>
      <paragraph>You can only enroll in the SHIP outside of your Open Enrollment period if you have had a qualifying life event (for example, involuntary loss of insurance, including due to turning age 26). This applies to the student medical, dental and vision plans; you cannot add the dental or vision plan outside of Open Enrollment without a qualifying event.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you are already enrolled in a SHIP plan, you can add dependents who have had a qualifying life event (for example, birth/adoption of a child or arrival to the U.S. for the first time during the coverage year).</paragraph>
      <paragraph>You have 90 days from the qualifying life event into enroll in the SHIP medical, dental or vision plan. You will also need to provide supporting documentation .</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Removing Dependents:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Dependents can be removed from your insurance plan at any time before March 31 of the coverage year.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>To make any of these changes, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The CMU SHIP is a national plan, with participating in-network providers in every state. To search for medical care, dental care, vision care and pharmacies in your desired location:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>For routine care, University Health Services (UHS) does not recommend specific providers, but if you are in need of non-urgent care:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Before scheduling any appointment, verify directly with each provider or facility that they participate in the CMU SHIP network.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Both inpatient and outpatient mental health services are covered 100% if the provider is in-network with the SHIP. If you are enrolled in the SHIP, there are a few options for locating services in your area:</paragraph>
      <paragraph>CMU SHIP (medical plan) members have access to the same health coverage benefits while abroad as they do while in the U.S. through BCBS Global Core, along with 24 hour emergency medical and travel assistance through the AXA Travel Assistance Program.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Yes. Students graduating in August are eligible to enroll in the medical SHIP for the month of August only. August-only enrollments are only available for the student medical plan; dental and vision plans are not available.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If you are in need of an August-only enrollment, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Students graduating in May are not eligible to extend their SHIP.  Your SHIP enrollment will terminate on August 1.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Students graduating in August are eligible to enroll in the SHIP for the month of August only. If you are in need of an August-only enrollment, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>CMU is not using Social Security Numbers for student insurance enrollment, but Highmark is required by law to send letters on an annual basis to members requesting their Social Security/Tax Identification Number. Members who do not provide this information will not be penalized, nor are they required to provide the information. Students may disregard the letter.</paragraph>
