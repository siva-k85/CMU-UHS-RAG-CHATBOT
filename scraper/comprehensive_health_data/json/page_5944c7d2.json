The most cost effective way to seek care is to see healthcare providers that are in-network. If you have the CMU SHIP and see an in-network provider, there is no\ndeductible\n.\nOut-of-Network providers do not participate in your insurance plan network. If you have the CMU medical SHIP and see an out-of-network provider, the plan will cover 80% of the cost of the service after you meet your\ndeductible\n. The dental plan has different\ncoinsurance\nrates.\nCopays\nCopays are a one-time payment at the time of service and can range depending on the service being provided. For the CMU SHIP, most copays are $0-$25. Some services have a higher copay, such as advanced imaging ($40), emergency room visits ($125), and hospital admissions ($150). You must pay the copay once for each visit where it is applicable. Prescriptions also incur a copay, but copays depend on the type of medication and frequency of refill.\nDeductible\nA deductible\nis the amount of money you pay for health care services\nbefore\nyour insurance plan starts to pay covered expenses. It is important to review insurance plans so you are aware if there is a deductible or not. Once the deductible is met, the plan will start covering benefits as outlined in the policy.\nThe CMU medical SHIP has no deductible for\nin-network care\n, but there is a deductible for\nout-of-network care\n. The dental SHIP has a deductible for both in-network and out-of-network care.\nCoinsurance\nCoinsurance\nis a portion of healthcare charges that the member is responsible to pay, usually after a\ndeductible\nhas been met. There is no coinsurance for in-network care with the CMU medical SHIP. For\nout-of-network care\nwith the CMU SHIP, you would be responsible for 20% of covered charges, after paying the deductible amount. Coinsurance rates vary depending on the plan and the service, so you must review plan(s) carefully.\nExplanation of Benefits (EOB)\nEOBs show the total charges for your visit and which portion of charges the health insurance plan will cover. EOBs are not bills. EOBs help you understand how much your health plan covers, and what you can expect to pay when you get a bill from your provider.\nStudents can access their EOBs in the claims section of their\nHighmark portal\n.\nPPO vs HMO Plans\nTHE CMU SHIP is a Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO plan.\nA PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) medical plan provides healthcare coverage through a network of providers, and you pay less if you use providers and hospitals within the plan's network. However, you can go outside of the network for an additional cost (see\ncoinsurance\n).\nAn HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) plan provides healthcare coverage through a network of providers, but you are generally limited to seeing providers within the HMO network for covered services, with limited or no coverage for out-of-network care (except for emergencies). HMO networks are generally limited to the area where the person lived at the time of their enrollment.\nDivision of Student Affairs\nAthletics, Physical Education & Recreation\nCareer & Professional Development Center\nCenter for Student Diversity & Inclusion\nCivility Initiatives\nCohon University Center\nCommunity Health & Well-Being\nCommunity Responsibility\nConference & Event Services\nCounseling & Psychological Services\nDean of Students\nDining Services\nFamily Engagement\nFirst-Year Orientation\nFraternity & Sorority Life\nHousing Services\nPre-College Programs\nResidential Education\nStudent Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement\nStudent Support Resources\nUniversity Health Services\nWellness & Meaning-Making Programs\nUHS Partners\nAccreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.\nDisability Resources\nTitle IX Initiatives\nUniversity Police\nUniversity Policies\nUniversity Health Services\nStudent Affairs\n100 Tech Street, 3rd Floor\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\n412-268-2157\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n©\n2025\nCarnegie Mellon University\nCMU on Facebook\nCMU on Twitter\nCMU on Instagram\nHealthConnect\nNew Students\nFamily & Parents\nStudent Insurance\nEnroll in the SHIP\nWaive the SHIP\nChange or Cancel the SHIP\nSHIP Benefits & Plan Documents\nSHIP Rates & Billing\nUsing the SHIP\nInternational, Exchange, & Study Abroad Students\nInsurance Literacy\nContacts & Common Questions\nLeaving CMU\nServices & Fees\nCOVID19\nSexual Assault Resources\nLGBTQIA+ Health\nSexual Health\nAllergy Injections\nHealth Education & Resources\nCulturally Responsive Bystander Intervention (CuRB)\nLocal Healthcare Resources\nPeer Health Advocates\nInformation for PHAs\nRecovery and Harm Reduction\nWellness To Go Machines\nAbout Us\nUHS News\nWho We Are\nLeaving CMU",
