Health Forms and Immunization Record Requirements
All new students to the Pittsburgh & Silicon Valley campuses must submit required health forms and immunization information, including uploading a CMU Immunization Record Form signed by their healthcare provider before arriving on campus. Students should log into
HealthConnect
and select Medical Clearances in the left menu to review and submit all required health information.
Failure to comply with immunization requirements will result in administrative suspension and removal from university housing.
