*TTOCLVL2*Benefit Period*TOCLVL2* he specified period of time during which charges for covered services must be incurred in order to be eligible
for payment by Highmark. A charge shall be considered incurred on the date you receive the service, product
or supply for which the charge is made.
Your benefit period is 12 consecutive months beginning on August 1.
Coinsurance
*TTOCLVL2*Coinsurance*TOCLVL2* hose remaining percentages or dollar amounts of the maximum allowable charge for a covered service that
are your responsibility after Highmark pays the percentages or dollar amounts shown on the Summary of
Benefits for a covered service.
Deductible
*ATOCLVL2*Deductible*TOCLVL2* specified amount of expenses set forth in the Summary of Benefits for covered services that you must be
pay before Highmark will pay any benefit.
Member Liability
*ITOCLVL2*Member Liability*TOCLVL2*n order to keep the program affordable for you, Highmark includes certain cost-sharing features. If the class or
service grouping is not covered under the program, the Summary of Benefits will indicate either “not covered”
or “Plan Pays -- 0%”. You will be responsible to pay your dentist the full charge for these uncovered services.
Classes or service groupings shown with “Plan Pays” percentages greater than 0% but less than 100% require
you to pay a portion of the cost for the covered service. For example, if the program pays 80%, your share or
coinsurance is 20% of the maximum allowable charge. You are also responsible to pay any deductibles,
charges exceeding the program maximums or charges for covered services performed before satisfaction of
any applicable waiting periods or which are not eligible for payment following the application of program benefit
limitations. If you receive covered services from an out-of network provider, the plan will apply the percentages
shown in the Summary of Benefits and you will be responsible for the difference, up to the provider’s charge.
Maximum
*TTOCLVL2*Maximum*TOCLVL2* he greatest amount Highmark is obligated to pay for all covered services rendered during a specified period
as shown in the Summary of Benefits.
Limitations
*CTOCLVL2*Limitations*TOCLVL2* ertain services on the Summary of Benefits are subject to frequency or age limitations See the section
Covered Services for any limitations. Before reviewing the limitations, you must first check the Summary of
Benefits to see which services are covered.

Payment For Network Covered Expenses
*ITOCLVL2*Payment For Network Covered Expenses*TOCLVL2*f you have services performed by a network dentist, Highmark will pay covered benefits directly to the network
dentist. Both you and the dentist will be notified of benefits covered, the plan's payment and any amounts you
owe for coinsurance, deductibles, charges exceeding annual maximums or charges for services not covered.
Payment will be based on the maximum allowable charge (MAC) that the treating network dentist has
contracted to accept. MAC charges may vary depending on the geographical area of the dental office and the
contract between Highmark or its designated agent and the particular network dentist rendering the service.
Network dentists agree by contract to accept MAC as payment in full for covered services rendered to you.
You shall be held harmless if, after receiving services from a network dentist, such services are determined not
to be dentally necessary.
Payment For Out-of-Network Covered Expenses
*ITOCLVL2*Payment For Out-of-Network Covered Expenses*TOCLVLf2* you receive services from an out-of-network dentist, Highmark will send payment for covered benefits to you,
unless the claim submitted by you indicates that payment should be sent directly to the dentist that performed
the services. This is called assignment of benefits, and is available for care delivered by out-of-network
dentists outside of Pennsylvania. You will still be notified whether the services you received are covered, the
plan payment and any amounts that you owe for coinsurance, deductibles, charges exceeding annual
maximums, services not covered due to benefit frequency limitations or charges for services not covered by
your program. Highmark's payment will be based on the maximum allowable charges (MAC) for the services.
Out-of-Network MAC is determined as a percentile of dentist charges for Covered Services by grouping the
90th percentile of dentist charges into different geographical areas which are used to calculate Highmark's
payment.You will be responsible to pay the dentist any difference between the plan's payment and the
out-of-network dentist's full charge for the services. Out-of-network dentists are not obligated to limit their fees
to the plan's MAC. Dental emergency services performed by an out-of-network dentist will be reimbursed by
the plan so that you are not liable for a greater out of pocket expense than if you were treated by a network
dentist.

How Your Program Works - Dental Program
*TEMPLATE*CCBSPA_CERT_DENTAL*TEMPLATE*
*CTOCLVL1*How Your Program Works - Dental Program*TOCLVL1* hoice of Provider
You may choose any licensed dentist for services. However, if you choose a network dentist, you limit your out
of pocket costs. Network dentists limit their fees to their contracted maximum allowable charges for covered
services. Also, if agreed by the provider, network dentists limit their charges for all services delivered to you,
even if the service is not covered for any reason and a benefit is not paid under your dental program. Network
dentists also complete and send claims for the covered services you receive directly to Highmark for
processing. To find a network dentist, visit Highmark's Web site at www.myHighmark.com or call the toll-free
number on the back of your dental identification card.
If you go to a dentist who is an out-of-network dentist, you may have to pay the dentist at the time of service
and complete and submit your own claims to Highmark for reimbursement. You will be responsible for the
dentist's full charge which may exceed Highmark's maximum allowable charge and result in higher out of
pocket costs.

about any address changes or changes in family status (births, adoptions, deaths, marriages, divorces, etc.)
that may affect your coverage.
Your newborn child may be covered under your program for a maximum of 31 days from the moment of birth.
To be covered as a dependent beyond the 31-day period, the newborn child must be enrolled as a dependent
under this program within such period.
Termination of Your Coverage Under the Group Contract
*YTOCLVL2*Termination of Your Coverage Under the Group Contract*TOCLVL2* our coverage can be terminated in the following instances:
l When you cease to be a student, your coverage will terminate at the end of the last month for which
payment was made.
l When you fail to pay the required contribution, coverage will terminate at the end of the last month for
which payment was made.
l Termination of the employer contract automatically terminates the coverage of all the members. It is the
responsibility of the employer to notify you of the termination of coverage. However, coverage will be
terminated regardless of whether the notice is given to you by the employer.
l If it is proven that you obtained or attempted to obtain benefits or payment for benefits through fraud or
intentional misrepresentation of a material fact, Highmark may, upon notice to you, terminate your
coverage under the program.
15

l It is understood that you have an affirmative obligation to notify the group or Highmark as soon as the
domestic partnership has been terminated. Upon termination of the domestic partnership, coverage of
the former domestic partner and the children of the former domestic partner will terminate at the end of
the last month for which payment was made.
Benefits After Coverage Terminates
*HTOCLVL2*Benefits After Coverage Terminates*TOCLVL2* ighmark is not liable to pay any benefits for dental services which are started after the termination date of
your coverage or of the group program. However, coverage for completion of a dental procedure requiring two
or more visits on separate days will be extended for a short period of 90 days after the termination date in
order for the procedure to be finished. The procedure must be started prior to the termination date. The
procedure is considered started when the teeth are irrevocably altered. For example, for crowns or fixed partial
dentures, the procedure is started when the teeth are prepared and impressions are taken. For root canals, the
procedure is started when the tooth is opened and pulp is removed. For orthodontic treatment, if covered under
your plan, coverage will be extended through the end of the month of the member’s termination date. This
extension does not apply if the program terminates for failure to pay premium.
College Tuition Reward Program
*TOCLVL2*College Tuition Reward Program*TOCLVL2*lvl 1. Highmark provides access to a College Tuition Reward Program (&quot;Program&quot;) made available by
SAGE CTB LLC (&quot;Sage&quot;). Sage represents and has agreements with a consortium of private
colleges and universities that participate in the Program.
2. Participation in the Program is at the sole option of the member.
3. Members who wish to participate in the Program can earn college tuition reward points that can be
converted into equivalent cash credits which may be applied to the tuition expenses that eligible
students incur when attending Sage participating colleges and universities. Credits are earned and
accumulate during the period in which the member is enrolled under this plan.
4. Information regarding Program details including a listing of participating colleges and universities
will be provided by Sage.
5. Highmark makes no representations and assumes no liability in connection with the Program or its
administration.
Coordination of Benefits
*ITOCLVL2*Coordination of Benefits*TOCLVL2*f you or your dependents are covered by any other dental program and receive a service covered by this
program and the other dental program, benefits will be coordinated. This means that one program will be
primary and determine its benefits before those of the other program and without considering the other
program's benefits. The other program will be secondary and determine its benefits after the primary program.
The secondary program's benefits may be reduced because of the primary program's payment. Each program
will provide only that portion of its benefit that is required to cover expenses. This prevents duplicate payments
and overpayments. Upon determination of primary or secondary liability, this program will determine payment.
The following words and phrases regarding the Coordination of Benefits (&quot;COB&quot;) provision are defined
as set forth below:
l Allowable Amount is the program allowance for items of expense, when the care is covered at least in
part by one or more programs covering the member for whom the claim is made.
16

l Claim Determination Period means a benefit year. However, it does not include any part of a year
during which a person has no coverage under this program.
l Other Dental Plan is any form of coverage which is separate from this program with which coordination
is allowed. Other Dental Plan will be any of the following which provides dental benefits, or services, for
the following: group insurance or group type coverage, whether insured or uninsured. It also includes
coverage other than school accident type coverage (including grammar, high school and college student
coverages) for accidents only, including athletic injury, either on a 24-hour basis or on a &quot;to and from
school basis,&quot; or group or group type hospital indemnity benefits of $100 per day or less.
l Primary Plan is the program which determines its benefits first and without considering the other
program's benefits. A program that does not include a COB provision may not take the benefits of
another program into account when it determines its benefits.
l Secondary Plan is the program which determines its benefits after those of the other plan (Primary
Plan). Benefits may be reduced because of the other program's (Primary Plan) benefits.
l Plan means this document, providing dental care benefits to which this COB provision applies and which
may be reduced as a result of the benefits of other dental plans.
The fair value of services provided by the Company will be considered to be the amount of benefits
paid by the Company. The Company will be fully discharged from liability to the extent of such
payment under this provision.
In order to determine which plan is primary, this Plan will use the following rules.
l If the other plan does not have a provision similar to this one, then that plan will be primary.
l If both plans have COB provisions, the plan covering the Member as a primary insured is determined
before those of the plan which covers the person as a Dependent.
l Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divorced -- The rules for the order of benefits for a
Dependent child when the parents are not separated or divorced are:
¡ The benefits of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before
those of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year;
¡ If both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the plan which covered the parent longer are
determined before those of the plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time;
¡ The word &quot;birthday&quot; refers only to month and day in a calendar year, not the year in which the
person was born;
¡ If the other plan does not follow the birthday rule, but instead has a rule based upon the gender of
the parent; and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule based upon
the gender of the parent will determine the order of benefits.
l Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced Parents -- If two or more plans cover a person as Dependent
child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the child are determined in this order:
¡ First, the plan of the parent with custody of the child.
¡ Then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; and
¡ Finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child.
¡ If the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the dental care
expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the plan of that
parent has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first. The plan
of the other parent will be the Secondary Plan.
¡ If the specific terms of the court decree state that the parents will share joint custody, without stating
that one of the parents is responsible for the dental care expenses of the child, the plans covering
the child will follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined in the above paragraph, titled
Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divorced.
17

l Active/Inactive Member
¡ For actively employed Members and their spouses over the age of 65 who are covered by
Medicare, the plan will be primary.
¡ When one contract is a retirement plan and the other is an active plan, the active plan is primary.
When two retirement plans are involved, the one in effect for the longest time is primary. If another
contract does not have this rule, then this rule will be ignored.
l If none of these rules apply, then the contract which has continuously covered the Member for a longer
period of time will be primary.
l The plan covering an individual as a COBRA continuee will be secondary to a plan covering that
individual as a Member or a Dependent.
Right to Receive and Release Needed Information -- Certain facts are needed to apply these COB rules.
The Plan has the right to decide which facts it needs. It may get needed facts from or give them to any other
organization or person. Any health information furnished to a third party will be released in accordance with
federal law. Each person claiming benefits under this Plan must give any facts needed to pay the claim.
Facility of Payment -- A payment made under another plan may include an amount which should have been
paid under this plan. If it does, the Plan may pay the amount to the organization which made that payment.
That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under this plan, and the Plan will not pay that
amount again. The term &quot;payment made&quot; includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case
&quot;payment made&quot; means reasonable cash value of the services prepaid by the Plan.
Right of Recovery -- If the payment made by the Plan is more than it should have paid under this COB
provision, the Plan may recover the excess from one or more of the following: (1) persons it has paid or for
whom it has paid; or (2) insurance companies; or (3) other organization. Members are required to assist the
Company to implement this section.
Force Majeure
*NTOCLVL2*Force Majeure*TOCLVL2* o failure, delay or default in performance of any obligation of Highmark shall constitute an event of default or
breach to the extent that such failure to perform, delay or default arises out of a cause, existing or future, that is
beyond the reasonable control and not the result of the negligence of Highmark. Such events include, by way
of illustration and not limitation, Acts of God, war (declared or undeclared), government regulation, acts or
inaction of governmental authority, civil or military authority, unforeseen disruptions caused by suppliers,
subcontractors, vendors or carriers, terrorism, disaster, strikes, civil-disorder, curtailment of transportation
facilities, fire, floods, blizzards, epidemics, pandemics, viral or communicable disease outbreaks, National
Emergency, quarantines, disruption of the labor force and/or any other cause which is beyond the reasonable
control of Highmark (hereinafter a &quot;Force Majeure Event&quot;), that makes it impossible, illegal or commercially
impracticable for Highmark to perform its obligations in whole or in part.
Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, Highmark shall take action to minimize the consequences of
the Force Majeure Event. If Highmark relies on any of the foregoing as an excuse for failure, default or delay in
performance, it shall give prompt written notice to the group of the facts that constitute such Force Majeure
Event, when it arose and when it is expected to cease.

How to File a Claim - Dental Program
*TEMPLATE*CCBSPA_CERT_DENTAL*TEMPLATE*
*NTOCLVL1*How to File a Claim - Dental Program*TOCLVL1* OTICE OF CLAIM AND PROOF OF LOSS
*NTOCLVL2*Notice of Claim and Proof of Loss*TOCLVL2* etwork Providers have directly or indirectly entered into an agreement with the Plan pertaining to the payment
for Covered Services rendered to a Member. When a Member receives Covered Services from a Network
Provider, it is the responsibility of the Network Provider to submit its claim to the Plan in accordance with the
terms of its participation agreement. Should the Network Provider fail to submit its claim in a timely manner or
otherwise satisfy the Plan’s requirements as they relate to the filing of claims, the Member will not be liable and
the Network Provider shall hold the Member harmless relative to payment of the Covered Services received by
the Member.
When Covered Services are received from other than a Network Provider, the Member is responsible for
submitting the claim to the Plan. In such instances, the Member must submit the claim in accordance with the
following procedures:
1. Notice of Claim
The Plan will not be liable for any claims under this Contract unless proper notice is furnished to the Plan
that Covered Services in this Contract have been rendered to a Member. Written notice of a claim must
be given to the Plan within twenty (20) days or as soon as reasonably possible after Covered Services
have been rendered to the Member. Notice given by or on behalf of the Member to the Plan that includes
information sufficient to identify the Member that received the Covered Services shall constitute sufficient
notice of a claim to the Plan. The Member can give notice to the Plan by writing to the Member Service
Department. The address of the Member Service Department can be found on the Member’s
Identification Card. A charge shall be considered Incurred on the date a Member receives the Service for
which the Charge is made.
2. Claim Forms
Proof of loss for benefits under this Contract must be submitted to the Plan on the appropriate claim form.
The Plan, upon receipt of a notice of a Claim will, within fifteen (15) days following the date a notice of a
claim is received, furnish to the Member claim forms for filing proofs of loss. If claim forms are not
furnished within fifteen (15) days after the giving of such notice, the Member shall be deemed to have
complied with the requirements of this Subsection as to filing a proof of loss upon submitting, within the
time fixed in this Subsection for filing proofs of loss, itemized bills for Covered Services as described
below. The proof of loss may be submitted to the Plan at the address appearing on the Member’s
Identification Card.
3. Proof of Loss
Claims cannot be paid until a written proof of loss is submitted to the Plan. Written proof of loss must be
provided to the Plan within twelve (12) months after the date of such loss. Proof of loss must include all
data necessary for the Plan to determine benefits. Failure to submit a proof of loss to the Plan within the
time specified will not invalidate or reduce any Claim if it is shown that the proof of loss was submitted as
soon as reasonably possible, but in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, will the Plan be
required to accept a proof of loss later than one (1) year from the time proof is otherwise required.
4. Submission of Claim Forms
The completed claim form, with all itemized bills attached, must be forwarded to the Plan at the address
appearing on the Member’s Identification Card in order to satisfy the requirement of submitting a written
proof of loss and to receive payment for benefits provided under this Contract.

complete and correct. Each claim form must be accompanied by itemized bills showing:
Person or organization providing the Service
Type of Service
Date of Service
Amount charged
Name of patient
Itemized bills cannot be returned.
A request for payment of a Claim will not be reviewed and no payment will be made unless all of the
information and evidence of payment required on the Claim form has been submitted in the manner
described above. The Plan reserves the right to require additional information and documents as needed
to support a claim that a Covered Service has been rendered.
Notice of the Plan’s claim determination will be issued within a reasonable period of time not to exceed
thirty (30) days following the receipt of a proper proof of loss. This period of time may be extended one
(1) time by the Plan for an additional period of time not to exceed fifteen (15) days provided the extension
is due to matters outside the control of the Plan and a written explanation for the delay is provided to the
Member.
In the event that the Plan renders an adverse decision on the Claim, the notification shall include, among
other items, the specific reason or reasons for the adverse decision and a statement describing the right
of the Member to file an appeal.

Claim payments for benefits payable under this Contract will be processed immediately upon receipt of a
proper proof of loss.
6. Authorized Representative
Nothing in this Subsection shall preclude a duly authorized representative of the Member from filing or
otherwise pursuing a Claim on behalf of the Member. The Plan reserves the right to establish reasonable
procedures for determining whether an individual has been authorized to act on behalf of the Member.
Predetermination
*ATOCLVL2*Predetermination*TOCLVL2* predetermination is a review in advance of treatment by Highmark to determine patient eligibility and
coverage for planned services. Predetermination is not required to receive a benefit for any service under the
program. However, it is recommended for extensive, more costly treatment such as crowns and bridges. A
predetermination gives you and your dentist an estimate of your coverage and how much your share of the
cost will be for the treatment being considered.
To have services predetermined, you or your dentist should submit a claim showing the planned procedures
but leaving out the dates of services. Be sure to sign the predetermination request. Substantiating material
such as radiographs and periodontal charting may be requested by Highmark to estimate benefits and
coverage. We will determine benefits payable, taking into account exclusions and limitations including alternate
treatment options based upon the provisions of the program. We will notify you of the estimated benefits.
When the services are performed, simply have your dentist contact us or fill in the dates of service for the
completed procedures on the predetermination notification and re-submit it to Highmark for processing. Any
20

predetermination amount estimated is subject to continued eligibility of the patient. We may also make
adjustments at the time of final payment to correct any mathematical errors, apply coordination of benefits, and
comply with your plan in effect and remaining program maximum dollars on the date of service.
Your Explanation of Benefits Statement
*WTOCLVL2*Your Explanation of Benefits Statement*TOCLVL2* hen you submit a claim, you will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statement that lists:
l the provider's actual charge;

reimbursement or other post-service claim on your behalf. Highmark reserves the right to establish
reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been authorized to act on your behalf.
l Requests for Reimbursement and Other Claims
When you receive services from a network provider, the provider will report the services to Highmark and
payment will be made directly to the provider. Highmark will also notify the provider of any amounts that
you are required to pay in the form of a copayment. If you believe that the determination of the
copayment amount is not correct or that any portion of those amounts are covered under your benefit
program, you may file a claim to have that amount paid.
Determinations on Benefit Claims

Highmark determines that the additional time is necessary due to matters outside its control, and notifies you of
the extension prior to the expiration of the initial 30-day claim determination period. If an extension of time is
necessary because you failed to submit information necessary for Highmark to make a decision on your claim,
the notice of extension that is sent to you will specifically describe the information that you must submit. In this
event, you will have at least 45 days in which to submit the information before a decision is made on your
claim.

How We Protect Your Right to Confidentiality
*TEMPLATE*CCBSPA_CERT_DENTAL*TEMPLATE*
*WTOCLVL1*How We Protect Your Right to Confidentiality*TOCLVL1* e have established policies and procedures to protect the privacy of our members' protected health
information (&quot;PHI&quot;) in all forms, including PHI given verbally, from unauthorized or improper use. Some of the
ways we protect your privacy include not discussing PHI outside of our offices, e.g., in hallways, elevators, as
well as verifying your identity before we discuss PHI with you over the phone. As permitted by law, we may use
or disclose protected health information for treatment, payment and health care operations, such as: claims
management, routine audits, coordination of care, quality assessment and measurement, case management,
utilization review, performance measurement, customer service, credentialing, medical review and
underwriting. With the use of measurement data, we are able to manage members' health care needs, even
targeting certain individuals for quality improvement programs, such as health, wellness and disease
management programs.
If we ever use your protected health information for non-routine uses, we will ask you to give us your
permission by signing a special authorization form, except with regard to court orders and subpoenas.
You have the right to access the information your doctor has been keeping in your medical records, and any
such request should be directed first to your network physician.
You benefit from the many safeguards we have in place to protect the use of data we maintain. This includes
requiring our employees to sign statements in which they agree to protect your confidentiality, using computer
passwords to limit access to your protected health information, and including confidentiality language in our
contracts with physicians, hospitals, vendors and other health care providers.
Our Privacy Department review and approves policies regarding the handling of confidential information.
Recognizing that you have a right to privacy in all settings, we even inspect the privacy of examination rooms
when we conduct on-site visits to physicians' offices. It's all part of safeguarding the confidentiality of your
protected health information.

to providers furnishing Covered Services provided under the program described in this benefit
booklet; however, Highmark reserves the right to make these payments directly to the member. The
right of a member to receive payment for a Covered Service described in this benefit booklet is not

be construed to make Highmark, the group health plan or the group health plan sponsor liable to any
assignee to whom a member may be liable for medical care, treatment, or services.

*BTOCLVL1*How Your Benefits Are Applied-Dental Program*TOCLVL1* enefit Period
*TTOCLVL2*Benefit Period*TOCLVL2* he specified period of time during which charges for covered services must be incurred in order to be eligible
for payment by Highmark. A charge shall be considered incurred on the date you receive the service, product
or supply for which the charge is made.
Your benefit period is 12 consecutive months beginning on August 1.
Coinsurance
*TTOCLVL2*Coinsurance*TOCLVL2* hose remaining percentages or dollar amounts of the maximum allowable charge for a covered service that
are your responsibility after Highmark pays the percentages or dollar amounts shown on the Summary of
Benefits for a covered service.
Deductible
*ATOCLVL2*Deductible*TOCLVL2* specified amount of expenses set forth in the Summary of Benefits for covered services that you must be
pay before Highmark will pay any benefit.
Member Liability
*ITOCLVL2*Member Liability*TOCLVL2*n order to keep the program affordable for you, Highmark includes certain cost-sharing features. If the class or
service grouping is not covered under the program, the Summary of Benefits will indicate either “not covered”
or “Plan Pays -- 0%”. You will be responsible to pay your dentist the full charge for these uncovered services.
Classes or service groupings shown with “Plan Pays” percentages greater than 0% but less than 100% require
you to pay a portion of the cost for the covered service. For example, if the program pays 80%, your share or
coinsurance is 20% of the maximum allowable charge. You are also responsible to pay any deductibles,
charges exceeding the program maximums or charges for covered services performed before satisfaction of
any applicable waiting periods or which are not eligible for payment following the application of program benefit
limitations. If you receive covered services from an out-of network provider, the plan will apply the percentages
shown in the Summary of Benefits and you will be responsible for the difference, up to the provider’s charge.
Maximum
*TTOCLVL2*Maximum*TOCLVL2* he greatest amount Highmark is obligated to pay for all covered services rendered during a specified period
as shown in the Summary of Benefits.
Limitations
*CTOCLVL2*Limitations*TOCLVL2* ertain services on the Summary of Benefits are subject to frequency or age limitations See the section
Covered Services for any limitations. Before reviewing the limitations, you must first check the Summary of
Benefits to see which services are covered.

    <page number="7">Payment For Network Covered Expenses
*ITOCLVL2*Payment For Network Covered Expenses*TOCLVL2*f you have services performed by a network dentist, Highmark will pay covered benefits directly to the network
dentist. Both you and the dentist will be notified of benefits covered, the plan's payment and any amounts you
owe for coinsurance, deductibles, charges exceeding annual maximums or charges for services not covered.
Payment will be based on the maximum allowable charge (MAC) that the treating network dentist has
contracted to accept. MAC charges may vary depending on the geographical area of the dental office and the
contract between Highmark or its designated agent and the particular network dentist rendering the service.
Network dentists agree by contract to accept MAC as payment in full for covered services rendered to you.
You shall be held harmless if, after receiving services from a network dentist, such services are determined not
to be dentally necessary.
Payment For Out-of-Network Covered Expenses
*ITOCLVL2*Payment For Out-of-Network Covered Expenses*TOCLVLf2* you receive services from an out-of-network dentist, Highmark will send payment for covered benefits to you,
unless the claim submitted by you indicates that payment should be sent directly to the dentist that performed
the services. This is called assignment of benefits, and is available for care delivered by out-of-network
dentists outside of Pennsylvania. You will still be notified whether the services you received are covered, the
plan payment and any amounts that you owe for coinsurance, deductibles, charges exceeding annual
maximums, services not covered due to benefit frequency limitations or charges for services not covered by
your program. Highmark's payment will be based on the maximum allowable charges (MAC) for the services.
Out-of-Network MAC is determined as a percentile of dentist charges for Covered Services by grouping the
90th percentile of dentist charges into different geographical areas which are used to calculate Highmark's
payment.You will be responsible to pay the dentist any difference between the plan's payment and the
out-of-network dentist's full charge for the services. Out-of-network dentists are not obligated to limit their fees
to the plan's MAC. Dental emergency services performed by an out-of-network dentist will be reimbursed by
the plan so that you are not liable for a greater out of pocket expense than if you were treated by a network
dentist.

You may choose any licensed dentist for services. However, if you choose a network dentist, you limit your out
of pocket costs. Network dentists limit their fees to their contracted maximum allowable charges for covered
services. Also, if agreed by the provider, network dentists limit their charges for all services delivered to you,
even if the service is not covered for any reason and a benefit is not paid under your dental program. Network
dentists also complete and send claims for the covered services you receive directly to Highmark for
processing. To find a network dentist, visit Highmark's Web site at www.myHighmark.com or call the toll-free
number on the back of your dental identification card.
If you go to a dentist who is an out-of-network dentist, you may have to pay the dentist at the time of service
and complete and submit your own claims to Highmark for reimbursement. You will be responsible for the
dentist's full charge which may exceed Highmark's maximum allowable charge and result in higher out of
pocket costs.

Termination of Your Coverage Under the Group Contract
*YTOCLVL2*Termination of Your Coverage Under the Group Contract*TOCLVL2* our coverage can be terminated in the following instances:
l When you cease to be a student, your coverage will terminate at the end of the last month for which
payment was made.
l When you fail to pay the required contribution, coverage will terminate at the end of the last month for
which payment was made.
l Termination of the employer contract automatically terminates the coverage of all the members. It is the
responsibility of the employer to notify you of the termination of coverage. However, coverage will be
terminated regardless of whether the notice is given to you by the employer.
l If it is proven that you obtained or attempted to obtain benefits or payment for benefits through fraud or
intentional misrepresentation of a material fact, Highmark may, upon notice to you, terminate your
coverage under the program.

domestic partnership has been terminated. Upon termination of the domestic partnership, coverage of
the former domestic partner and the children of the former domestic partner will terminate at the end of
the last month for which payment was made.
Benefits After Coverage Terminates
*HTOCLVL2*Benefits After Coverage Terminates*TOCLVL2* ighmark is not liable to pay any benefits for dental services which are started after the termination date of
your coverage or of the group program. However, coverage for completion of a dental procedure requiring two
or more visits on separate days will be extended for a short period of 90 days after the termination date in
order for the procedure to be finished. The procedure must be started prior to the termination date. The
procedure is considered started when the teeth are irrevocably altered. For example, for crowns or fixed partial
dentures, the procedure is started when the teeth are prepared and impressions are taken. For root canals, the
procedure is started when the tooth is opened and pulp is removed. For orthodontic treatment, if covered under
your plan, coverage will be extended through the end of the month of the member’s termination date. This
extension does not apply if the program terminates for failure to pay premium.
College Tuition Reward Program
*TOCLVL2*College Tuition Reward Program*TOCLVL2*lvl 1. Highmark provides access to a College Tuition Reward Program (&quot;Program&quot;) made available by
SAGE CTB LLC (&quot;Sage&quot;). Sage represents and has agreements with a consortium of private
colleges and universities that participate in the Program.
2. Participation in the Program is at the sole option of the member.
3. Members who wish to participate in the Program can earn college tuition reward points that can be
converted into equivalent cash credits which may be applied to the tuition expenses that eligible
students incur when attending Sage participating colleges and universities. Credits are earned and
accumulate during the period in which the member is enrolled under this plan.
4. Information regarding Program details including a listing of participating colleges and universities
will be provided by Sage.
5. Highmark makes no representations and assumes no liability in connection with the Program or its
administration.
Coordination of Benefits
*ITOCLVL2*Coordination of Benefits*TOCLVL2*f you or your dependents are covered by any other dental program and receive a service covered by this
program and the other dental program, benefits will be coordinated. This means that one program will be
primary and determine its benefits before those of the other program and without considering the other
program's benefits. The other program will be secondary and determine its benefits after the primary program.
The secondary program's benefits may be reduced because of the primary program's payment. Each program
will provide only that portion of its benefit that is required to cover expenses. This prevents duplicate payments
and overpayments. Upon determination of primary or secondary liability, this program will determine payment.
The following words and phrases regarding the Coordination of Benefits (&quot;COB&quot;) provision are defined
as set forth below:
l Allowable Amount is the program allowance for items of expense, when the care is covered at least in
part by one or more programs covering the member for whom the claim is made.
16</page>
    <page number="17">l Claim Determination Period means a benefit year. However, it does not include any part of a year
during which a person has no coverage under this program.
l Other Dental Plan is any form of coverage which is separate from this program with which coordination
is allowed. Other Dental Plan will be any of the following which provides dental benefits, or services, for
the following: group insurance or group type coverage, whether insured or uninsured. It also includes
coverage other than school accident type coverage (including grammar, high school and college student
coverages) for accidents only, including athletic injury, either on a 24-hour basis or on a &quot;to and from
school basis,&quot; or group or group type hospital indemnity benefits of $100 per day or less.
l Primary Plan is the program which determines its benefits first and without considering the other
program's benefits. A program that does not include a COB provision may not take the benefits of
another program into account when it determines its benefits.
l Secondary Plan is the program which determines its benefits after those of the other plan (Primary
Plan). Benefits may be reduced because of the other program's (Primary Plan) benefits.
l Plan means this document, providing dental care benefits to which this COB provision applies and which
may be reduced as a result of the benefits of other dental plans.
The fair value of services provided by the Company will be considered to be the amount of benefits
paid by the Company. The Company will be fully discharged from liability to the extent of such
payment under this provision.
In order to determine which plan is primary, this Plan will use the following rules.
l If the other plan does not have a provision similar to this one, then that plan will be primary.
l If both plans have COB provisions, the plan covering the Member as a primary insured is determined
before those of the plan which covers the person as a Dependent.
l Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divorced -- The rules for the order of benefits for a
Dependent child when the parents are not separated or divorced are:
¡ The benefits of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before
those of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year;
¡ If both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the plan which covered the parent longer are
determined before those of the plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time;
¡ The word &quot;birthday&quot; refers only to month and day in a calendar year, not the year in which the
person was born;
¡ If the other plan does not follow the birthday rule, but instead has a rule based upon the gender of
the parent; and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule based upon
the gender of the parent will determine the order of benefits.
l Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced Parents -- If two or more plans cover a person as Dependent
child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the child are determined in this order:
¡ First, the plan of the parent with custody of the child.
¡ Then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; and
¡ Finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child.
¡ If the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the dental care
expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the plan of that
parent has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first. The plan
of the other parent will be the Secondary Plan.
¡ If the specific terms of the court decree state that the parents will share joint custody, without stating
that one of the parents is responsible for the dental care expenses of the child, the plans covering
the child will follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined in the above paragraph, titled
Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divorced.
17</page>
    <page number="18">l Active/Inactive Member
¡ For actively employed Members and their spouses over the age of 65 who are covered by
Medicare, the plan will be primary.
¡ When one contract is a retirement plan and the other is an active plan, the active plan is primary.
When two retirement plans are involved, the one in effect for the longest time is primary. If another
contract does not have this rule, then this rule will be ignored.
l If none of these rules apply, then the contract which has continuously covered the Member for a longer
period of time will be primary.
l The plan covering an individual as a COBRA continuee will be secondary to a plan covering that
individual as a Member or a Dependent.
Right to Receive and Release Needed Information -- Certain facts are needed to apply these COB rules.
The Plan has the right to decide which facts it needs. It may get needed facts from or give them to any other
organization or person. Any health information furnished to a third party will be released in accordance with
federal law. Each person claiming benefits under this Plan must give any facts needed to pay the claim.
Facility of Payment -- A payment made under another plan may include an amount which should have been
paid under this plan. If it does, the Plan may pay the amount to the organization which made that payment.
That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under this plan, and the Plan will not pay that
amount again. The term &quot;payment made&quot; includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case
&quot;payment made&quot; means reasonable cash value of the services prepaid by the Plan.
Right of Recovery -- If the payment made by the Plan is more than it should have paid under this COB
provision, the Plan may recover the excess from one or more of the following: (1) persons it has paid or for
whom it has paid; or (2) insurance companies; or (3) other organization. Members are required to assist the
Company to implement this section.
Force Majeure

impracticable for Highmark to perform its obligations in whole or in part.
Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, Highmark shall take action to minimize the consequences of
the Force Majeure Event. If Highmark relies on any of the foregoing as an excuse for failure, default or delay in
performance, it shall give prompt written notice to the group of the facts that constitute such Force Majeure
Event, when it arose and when it is expected to cease.

for Covered Services rendered to a Member. When a Member receives Covered Services from a Network
Provider, it is the responsibility of the Network Provider to submit its claim to the Plan in accordance with the
terms of its participation agreement. Should the Network Provider fail to submit its claim in a timely manner or
otherwise satisfy the Plan’s requirements as they relate to the filing of claims, the Member will not be liable and
the Network Provider shall hold the Member harmless relative to payment of the Covered Services received by
the Member.
When Covered Services are received from other than a Network Provider, the Member is responsible for
submitting the claim to the Plan. In such instances, the Member must submit the claim in accordance with the
following procedures:
1. Notice of Claim
The Plan will not be liable for any claims under this Contract unless proper notice is furnished to the Plan
that Covered Services in this Contract have been rendered to a Member. Written notice of a claim must
be given to the Plan within twenty (20) days or as soon as reasonably possible after Covered Services
have been rendered to the Member. Notice given by or on behalf of the Member to the Plan that includes
information sufficient to identify the Member that received the Covered Services shall constitute sufficient
notice of a claim to the Plan. The Member can give notice to the Plan by writing to the Member Service
Department. The address of the Member Service Department can be found on the Member’s
Identification Card. A charge shall be considered Incurred on the date a Member receives the Service for
which the Charge is made.
2. Claim Forms
Proof of loss for benefits under this Contract must be submitted to the Plan on the appropriate claim form.
The Plan, upon receipt of a notice of a Claim will, within fifteen (15) days following the date a notice of a
claim is received, furnish to the Member claim forms for filing proofs of loss. If claim forms are not
furnished within fifteen (15) days after the giving of such notice, the Member shall be deemed to have
complied with the requirements of this Subsection as to filing a proof of loss upon submitting, within the
time fixed in this Subsection for filing proofs of loss, itemized bills for Covered Services as described
below. The proof of loss may be submitted to the Plan at the address appearing on the Member’s
Identification Card.
3. Proof of Loss
Claims cannot be paid until a written proof of loss is submitted to the Plan. Written proof of loss must be
provided to the Plan within twelve (12) months after the date of such loss. Proof of loss must include all
data necessary for the Plan to determine benefits. Failure to submit a proof of loss to the Plan within the
time specified will not invalidate or reduce any Claim if it is shown that the proof of loss was submitted as
soon as reasonably possible, but in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, will the Plan be
required to accept a proof of loss later than one (1) year from the time proof is otherwise required.
4. Submission of Claim Forms
The completed claim form, with all itemized bills attached, must be forwarded to the Plan at the address
appearing on the Member’s Identification Card in order to satisfy the requirement of submitting a written
proof of loss and to receive payment for benefits provided under this Contract.
19</page>

complete and correct. Each claim form must be accompanied by itemized bills showing:
Person or organization providing the Service
Type of Service
Date of Service
Amount charged
Name of patient
Itemized bills cannot be returned.
A request for payment of a Claim will not be reviewed and no payment will be made unless all of the
information and evidence of payment required on the Claim form has been submitted in the manner
described above. The Plan reserves the right to require additional information and documents as needed
to support a claim that a Covered Service has been rendered.
Notice of the Plan’s claim determination will be issued within a reasonable period of time not to exceed
thirty (30) days following the receipt of a proper proof of loss. This period of time may be extended one
(1) time by the Plan for an additional period of time not to exceed fifteen (15) days provided the extension

Predetermination
*ATOCLVL2*Predetermination*TOCLVL2* predetermination is a review in advance of treatment by Highmark to determine patient eligibility and
coverage for planned services. Predetermination is not required to receive a benefit for any service under the
program. However, it is recommended for extensive, more costly treatment such as crowns and bridges. A
predetermination gives you and your dentist an estimate of your coverage and how much your share of the
cost will be for the treatment being considered.
To have services predetermined, you or your dentist should submit a claim showing the planned procedures
but leaving out the dates of services. Be sure to sign the predetermination request. Substantiating material
such as radiographs and periodontal charting may be requested by Highmark to estimate benefits and
coverage. We will determine benefits payable, taking into account exclusions and limitations including alternate
treatment options based upon the provisions of the program. We will notify you of the estimated benefits.
When the services are performed, simply have your dentist contact us or fill in the dates of service for the
completed procedures on the predetermination notification and re-submit it to Highmark for processing. Any

Filing Benefit Claims

You have the right to designate an authorized representative to file or pursue a request for
reimbursement or other post-service claim on your behalf. Highmark reserves the right to establish
reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been authorized to act on your behalf.
l Requests for Reimbursement and Other Claims
When you receive services from a network provider, the provider will report the services to Highmark and
payment will be made directly to the provider. Highmark will also notify the provider of any amounts that
you are required to pay in the form of a copayment. If you believe that the determination of the
copayment amount is not correct or that any portion of those amounts are covered under your benefit
program, you may file a claim to have that amount paid.
Determinations on Benefit Claims
*NTOCLVL2*Determinations on Benefit Claims*TOCLVL2* otice of Adverse Benefit Determinations Involving Requests for Reimbursement and Other Claims
If you have submitted a claim for services of an out-of-network provider, Highmark will notify you in writing of its
determination on your request for reimbursement or other claim within a reasonable period of time following
receipt of your claim. That period of time will not exceed 30 days from the date your claim was received.
However, this 30-day period of time may be extended one time for an additional 15 days, provided that
Highmark determines that the additional time is necessary due to matters outside its control, and notifies you of
the extension prior to the expiration of the initial 30-day claim determination period. If an extension of time is
necessary because you failed to submit information necessary for Highmark to make a decision on your claim,
the notice of extension that is sent to you will specifically describe the information that you must submit. In this
event, you will have at least 45 days in which to submit the information before a decision is made on your
claim.
If your request for reimbursement or other claim is denied, you will receive written notification of that denial
which will include, among other items, the specific reason or reasons for the adverse benefit determination and
a statement describing your right to file an appeal.
